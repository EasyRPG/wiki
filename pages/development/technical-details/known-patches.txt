====== Known patches ======

There are many different patches, hacks and other dubious methods to add new functionality to RPG Maker. This page tries to list them.

Unofficial RPG Maker functionality can come in the following forms:

  * modified engine executable, RPG_RT.exe,
  * IPS file (they can be used to modify the executable by a tool like LunarIPS, or applied dynamically by DynRPG),
  * HPA file to modify the executable by HyperPatcher2,
  * manual replacement of values at given offsets (can be done in hex editor, or applied dynamically through QuickPatches in DynRPG)
  * replacement for the audio library, Harmony.dll,
  * DynRPG plugins to be applied by DynRPG,
  * external utilities called by some other patch.

===== Harmony.dll replacements =====

Changing harmony.dll allows to do external without modifying the main binary.

Harmony.dll is used for audio playback in RPG Maker 2000 (except Value!) and RPG Maker 2003 up to version 1.04. A patch, Force Harmony, was made to allow using Harmony.dll in newer RPG Maker 2003.

==== Key Patch by Ineluki ====

Supports: RPG Maker 2000 (except Value), RPG Maker 2003 up to version 1.04

Executes scripts via the 'Play sound' command, and returns data through the midi ticks. Scripts are stored as sounds with .script.wav extension (the format of .script.wav is similar to INI files). Also, allows to play MP3 files by creating text files with .link.wav extension.

Scripts allow to:
  * Get full keyboard input
  * Get mouse input
  * Execute arbitrary programs
  * Execute [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd797790%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|MCI command]]
  * Write information to log

Since it allows to execute arbitrary exe files, it opened a way for a lot of smaller utilities.

===== RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 patches =====

==== Auto Enter Patch by Miroku ===

Skips the title screen of RPG Maker, allowing to create custom title screens.

Similar patch is available for RPG Maker 2003.

FIXME [description, examples]

Download: http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/AutoEnterPatch.exe

==== BetterAEP by Cherry ====

Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08 (distributed as a modified binary)

Skips the title screen (like Auto Enter Patch) and allows to call load menu and exit game.

Stop Parallel Events is modified: when variable 3350 contains the value of 1, it calls a save menu. When variable 3350, it exits the game. When it contains any other value, Stop Parallel Events works as expected.

==== PicPointerPatch ====

Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08 (distributed as IPS patches)

Allows to use the ID of picture stored in a variable.

If N+10000 is entered as a picture ID, the picture ID is read from variable N.

If N+50000 is entered as a picture ID, the picture ID is read from variable N, and the last 4 digits of variable (N+1) replace the last 4 characters of the picture name (for example, if TestTest.png is selected, and N+1 contains 5, then the filename will be Test0005.png).

==== CharExpand Patch by Cherry / Il Segugio ====

Allows to use character graphics with arbitrary dimensions, as in newer RPG Maker versions. For this, Charsets must be named %XXYYName.png, where XX is width of one sprite divided by 4, and YY is height of one sprite divided by 4.

An adaptation of this script for RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.08 was made by Il Segugio.

==== PicsInBattle ====

Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08

This patch allows to show pictures in battle. Patch is available in HPA format for HyperPatcher 2.

By default, pictures are not visible in the battle scene. Even they exist and can be manipulated through calling common events, they will become visible only after the battle ends. This patch allows to see all the pictures during the battle.

===== RPG Maker 2000 patches =====

==== Enter Hero Name Patch by Deejee ====

Supports: RPG Maker 2000 v 1.05 (distributed as modified RPG_RT.exe)

This patch fixed the 'Enter Hero Name' bug (the game freezed when executing this command) introduced in Don Miguel’s English translation.

==== Destiny Patch by Bananen-Joe ====

Supports: RPG Maker 2000 v. 1.05 and 1.07

Description here: http://www.rpga.info/forum/showthread.php?p=422053#post422053

===== RPG Maker 2003 patches =====

FIXME

==== Force Harmony by Bananen-Joe and Cherry ===

Starting with version 1.05, RPG Maker 2003 doesn’t use Harmony.dll for music playback. The newer code allows to play MP3, but Harmony.dll was used not just for playing music — it was a DLL for executing custom code, as done by Ineluki's Key Patch (see above),

To allow using Ineluki's Key Patch and other Harmony Replacements, this patch changes RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.05 and above to use Harmony.dll. After this, RM2k3 v. 1.05 and above can no longer play MP3, since Harmony.dll doesn’t support MP3 (unless another patch like Disharmony is used).

==== DynRPG by Cherry ===

Supports: RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.08

An ambitious project to create a C++ SDK for RPG Maker 2003. Allows to create many different plugins. Unfortunately, they are Windows-specific.

Description here: http://rpg-maker.cherrytree.at/dynrpg/

===== Known hacks =====

Some hacks are not presented as patches, but instead are done by every game creator manually, either with a hex editor, or with a specialised program.

==== Changed resources (EXFONT, logos, icons) ====

The simplest type of hacks involves change of resources using Windows resource editors, such as [[http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/|Resource Hacker]] (proprietary freeware).

This way you can change an:
  * **EXFONT**, a font containing additional characters available via the $ sign,
  * Enterbrain/ASCII logos at the beginning of the game,
  * application icon.

FIXME [Need examples]

==== Changed fonts ====

Using custom fonts may be required if your language is not supported.

Cherry’s Font Changer ([[http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/chgfont.exe|download]]) and [[http://cherrytree.at/cms/download/?did=10|HyperPatcher2]] allow to do this automatically, but it’s not hard to do in a hex editor either.

**Note.** Changing fonts doesn’t always require hacking an exe file. Sometimes games don’t change the font name, and just replace the default font (e. g. Czech game [[https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hearts_%28hra%29|Broken Hearts]] comes with its own RMG2000 font).

FIXME [Need description and examples]

==== Changed characters in 'Enter hero name' form ====

FIXME [Need description and examples]

==== Text speed change ====

The [[http://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/368/|2k3 Hack: The end of your slow text speed woes!]] tutorial on http://rpgmaker.net describes how to change the font speed.

FIXME [Need examples]

==== Additional data ====

Cherry’s Hyper Patcher ([[http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/hyperp.exe|download]]; supports RPG Maker 2000 v 1.05, RPG Maker 2003 v1.04 and RPG Maker 2003 v1.08) allows to change a number of other things, mostly cosmetic:

  * Main:
    * 'Anderes KS-Design' {?},
    * Hide start logos,
  * Title screen changes:
    * Automatically move cursor to 'Load',
    * Show 'Load' even when there is no data,
    * Swap 'Load' and 'End' functions,
    * Show only 2 first entries
    * Position of X, Y on the title screen
    * Never draw the 'Load' menu in gray
  * In-game menu changes:
    * Hide last items in the RM2k menu (Item, Skill, Equip, Save, Exit; or Item, Skill, Equip, Save; or Item, Skill, Equip; or Item, Skill)
    * Change colour of different menu items
    * Hide party gold
  * Load/save menu:
    * Hide HP
    * Hide level

===== External utilities =====

Sometimes external programs are made to be called through the Ineluki's key patch (or other means?).
