====== Known patches ======

===== Harmony.dll replacements =====

Changing harmony.dll allows to do external without modifying the main binary.

==== Key Patch by Ineluki ====

Supports: RPG Maker 2000 (except Value), RPG Maker 2003 up to version 1.04

Executes scripts via the 'Play sound' command, and returns data through the midi ticks. Scripts are stored as sounds with .script.wav extension (the format of .script.wav is similar to INI files). Also, allows to play MP3 files by creating text files with .link.wav extension.

Scripts allow to:
  * Get full keyboard input
  * Get mouse input
  * Execute arbitrary programs
  * Execute [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd797790%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|MCI command]]
  * Write information to log

Since it allows to execute arbitrary exe files, it opened a way for a lot of smaller utilities.

Similar patch is available for RPG Maker 2003.

FIXME [description, examples]

==== BetterAEP by Cherry ====

Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08 (distributed as a modified binary)

Skips the title screen (like Auto Enter Patch) and allows to call load menu and exit game.

Stop Parallel Events is modified: when variable 3350 contains the value of 1, it calls a save menu. When variable 3350, it exits the game. When it contains any other value, Stop Parallel Events works as expected.

===== Known hacks =====

Some hacks are not presented as patches, but instead are done by every game creator manually, either with a hex editor, or with a specialised program.

==== Changed resources (EXFONT, logos, icons) ====

The simplest type of hacks involves change of resources using Windows resource editors, such as [[http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/|Resource Hacker]] (proprietary freeware).

This way you can change an:
  * **EXFONT**, a font containing additional characters available via the $ sign,
  * Enterbrain/ASCII logos at the beginning of the game,
  * application icon.

FIXME [Need examples]

==== Changed fonts ====

Using custom fonts may be required if your language is not supported.

Cherry’s Font Changer ([[http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/chgfont.exe|download]]) allows to do this automatically, but it’s not hard to do in a hex editor either.

**Note.** Changing fonts doesn’t always require hacking an exe file. Sometimes games don’t change the font name, and just replace the default font (e. g. Czech game [[https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hearts_%28hra%29|Broken Hearts]] comes with its own RMG2000 font).

FIXME [Need description and examples]

==== Changed characters in 'Enter hero name' form ====

FIXME [Need description and examples]

==== Text speed change ====

The [[http://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/368/|2k3 Hack: The end of your slow text speed woes!]] tutorial on http://rpgmaker.net describes how to change the font speed.

FIXME [Need examples]

==== Additional data ====

Cherry’s Hyper Patcher ([[http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/hyperp.exe|download]]; supports RPG Maker 2000 v 1.05, RPG Maker 2003 v1.04 and RPG Maker 2003 v1.08) allows to change a number of other things, mostly cosmetic:

  * Main:
    * 'Anderes KS-Design' {?},
    * Hide start logos,
  * Title screen changes:
    * Automatically move cursor to 'Load',
    * Show 'Load' even when there is no data,
    * Swap 'Load' and 'End' functions,
    * Show only 2 first entries
    * Position of X, Y on the title screen
    * Never draw the 'Load' menu in gray
  * In-game menu changes:
    * Hide last items in the RM2k menu (Item, Skill, Equip, Save, Exit; or Item, Skill, Equip, Save; or Item, Skill, Equip; or Item, Skill)
    * Change colour of different menu items
    * Hide party gold
  * Load/save menu:
    * Hide HP
    * Hide level

Sometimes external programs are made to be called through the Ineluki's key patch (or other means?).
