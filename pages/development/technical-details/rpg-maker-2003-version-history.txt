===== Version 1.05 (May 13, 2003) =====

  * The picture limit is increased from 40 to 50.
  * When using "key input processing", it is now possible to disallow input of certain direction keys while allowing others.

  * MP is now indicated in the "traditional" battle system type.

==== Changed Features: ====

  * The variance in the number of steps between encounters for a given encounter rate has been reduced.

===== Version 1.04 (March 1, 2003) =====

==== New Features: ====

  * When a monster afflicted with a status ailment is targeted, the name of the highest priority status ailment that monster is afflicted with will appear in a one-line message window at the top of the screen.
  * During test play, you can now change the value of a variable to a seven-digit number when using the debug screen.

==== Deleted Feature: ====

  * When the feature-set was changed to show battle system messages on one line, the "show parameter increase on level-up" checkbox stopped working. This checkbox has now been deleted.

==== Changed Feature: ====

  * The way attribute damage modifiers for weapons are calculated has been changed as described below:
    * When a character attacks, the one weapon attribute and the one magic attribute with the highest damage multipliers are chosen from all weapon and magic attributes linked to that attack.
    * The actual damage multiplier is an average of the two attributes chosen as described above. For instance, if the damage multiplier for the weapon attribute is 200% and the damage multiplier for the magic attribute is 50%, then the actual damage multiplier used is 200% x 50% = 100%.
    * If one or both of the attributes has a negative damage multiplier (absorption), then the damage multiplier used is the largest of the negative values. For instance, if the damage multiplier for the weapon attribute is 200%, and the damage multiplier for the magic attribute is -50%, then the actual damage multiplier used is -50%.

==== Bug Fixes: ====

  * When using a battle event with the trigger "Monster HP above X% and below Y%", the problem where the triggered event was beginning during the damage animation was fixed.
  * The problem where there was a delay in the execution of skills or items of the type "Switch ON" has been fixed.
  * The problem where the wrong hero would receive poison damage if another hero selected his action before the poisoned hero finished his action was fixed.
  * The problem where sometimes battle events with the trigger "Monster HP above X% and below Y%" that only concerned the first enemy in a group would not execute was corrected.
  * When a "show picture" event with the option "picture scrolls with map" was used, sometimes a "move picture" event would move the picture to the wrong coordinates, as if the "picture scrolls with map" box hadn't been checked. This problem has been fixed.
  * The problem where an incorrect number of floppies was required to make a game disk was corrected. This was causing game disks extracted by other means than executing "setup.exe" to become corrupt.
  * Fixed the problem where a hero afflicted with a status ailment that caused him to attack his allies and equipped with a weapon that inflicts a status ailment had no chance of inflicting that weapon's status ailment on the attacked ally.
  * Fixed the problem where sometimes the hero would not face the proper direction after a "teleport" event command.
  * The problem where the use of "Link to Event" type battle commands would freeze the battle is fixed.
  * Fixed the problem where no more than 999 damage was dealt when using the "% of current HP" option in the "Change Monster HP" event command.

===== Version 1.02 (January 15, 2003) =====

  * During battle, if a skill or item is used, the name of the skill or item is shown briefly in a one-line message window before it executes.

==== Bug Fixes: ====

  * Corrected the problem in which the level up message was not being shown if the checkbox "show level-up message" in the battle event "Change character level" was checked.
  * The "change monster MP" battle event now allows the MP to be increased or decreased by up to 9999 rather than 999.
  * Corrected the problem with the experience curve settings that sometimes made it so that more experience was required to go from level 1 to level 2 than to go from level 2 to level 3.
  * The problem where sometimes battle events with the trigger "Hero's HP between 0% and 0%" would not execute properly when the chosen hero's HP becomes 0.
  * The problem where a character with the "two weapons" option would attack twice if unarmed was fixed.
