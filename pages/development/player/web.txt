=====EasyRPG Player for the Web=====

EasyRPG supports running games directly inside your web browser.

If you want to test it you can play with a [[https://easy-rpg.org/play/?game=testgame-2000|Demo of our TestGame]]. Try also a working game: [[https://easy-rpg.org/play/?game=ib|Ib]]

===How does it work===

Web request are asynchronous. This means that all assets like pictures and music must be fetched asynchronously. When the Player wants to display a new graphic it will appear on the desktop versions (Windows, Linux, Android, ...) immedieately but on the web it will be invisible while the file is downloaded. Once the downloaded finishes it is replaced with the real image.

In contrast to images and music some files are important to continue execution. When a map file is pending the Player will halt until the file is downloaded. The first halt is while the Logo is displayed on startup, it downloads the database and the maptree here. Download of map files is blocking, too. But this is usually not noticable because the download is executed while the fadeout animation plays (it will stay black when the map downloading takes longer then this).

===Hosting your own games===

Hosting your own games is quite simple. Just follow these three steps.

== Deploying the Player on your server ==

[[https://easy-rpg.org/jenkins/job/player-js/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/player-js.tar.gz|Download this archive]] and extract it on your server.

Your server needs support for PHP (most servers support this).

You will get the following files:

  * index.html
  * index.js
  * index.html.mem
  * games/index.php

== Preprocessing steps for games ==

Because of current player for the web is not supporting MIDI playback in browser yet (see [[https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/issues/560|bug #560]]) you must convert all your ''MIDI'' and ''MP3'' audio files to OGG Vorbis.

To convert MIDI to OGG run FIXME.

To convert MP3 to OGG run FIXME.

== Deploying a game on your server ==

The following only apply when you use our ''index.php''.

Your games are expected in subdirectories of the ''games'' directory. The default game executed is the one in ''games/default''. You can create further games by just putting them in subdirectories of the ''games'' directory. Because of security considerations (directory traversal) your directory name may not contain ''.'', ''\'' or ''cache''.

If your ''games'' directory is not writable for PHP create a ''cache'' folder in ''games'' and give it write permissions. You can skip this step if ''games'' is writable. You can revoke read permission on this folder for world/others.

Run ''games/?update'' once. You have to run this each time you change files of the game. For other games then default use ''games/?update&game=folder_name''.

Now open the ''index.html'' file and your default game should start. To play a different game pass ''?game=folder_name'' to your index file.

===Technical details about the server side===

The ''index.php'' works as a file finder which allows case-insensitive lookup of files.

Depending on the requested ''file'' it either returns ''404'' or a ''Location''-header to the file on the server.

This is required because Windows is case-insensitive (and original RPG2k was for Windows) and because the file extensions are not stored. ''Charset/Hero1'' could be ''Hero1.png'', hero1.bmp or ''HeRo1.xyz'', depending on which file exists.

== Example ==

The file ''System/System1'' is requested. The server returns ''Location: games/default/System/System1.png''. The same result is expected for file ''SyStEm/systEM1''.

== API ==

Our file finder is stored under ''src/platform/easyrpg-filefinder.php''. In case you want to replace the file finder you only have to fulfill a very simple API.

The directory struture of the ''games'' folder is not part of the API contract. The player only expects that accessing ''games/'' invokes the file finder.

The only GET arguments that must be supported are ''game'' and ''file''.

''game'' is the name of the game that is executed.

''file'' is the name of the file the game requests.

When a ''file'' is requested it must return a downloadable representation of the file. How doesn't matter, it can be an ''octet-stream'' or a redirect via ''Location''-header. If the file is not found ''404'' must be returned.
