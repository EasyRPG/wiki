=====TODO=====
This is the project TODO list.

====Player2====
===Codelite===
   * Make sure the project is updated on linux and windows.
   * Update precompiled libraries.
===Visual Studio===
   * Update precompiled libraries.
===Reader===
   * Make sure all data chunks are listed correctly.
   * Fix map events reading.
   * Replace FILE* with a custom class object wrapping it. (So if we have to modify C file functions, we don't have to go through all code)
   * Move the reader into a library (along with a data writer), so Editor and Player can link against it without having duplicated code in both projects.
===Multimedia===
   * Work on a Backend system, specially for Graphics. Common functions should be wrapped, so porting can be easier when the libraries need to be changed.
==Graphics==
   * Implement a dirty rect system, for not redrawing the screen every frame.
   * Implement RPG Maker 2K/2K3 text drawing system (Applying from system graphics a color gradient).
   * Implement sprite rotation. (SDL GFX?)
   * Tilemap.
===Engine===
   * Implement diverse classes (Game, Sprite, Window, Scene), too many for listing. Look at RPG Maker XP and VX script as a base.
