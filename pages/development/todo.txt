====== TODO ======
This is the project TODO list.

Issues for Readers, Player and Editor can be found in the [[http://easy-rpg.org/bugs/|tracker]].

===== Player =====

==== Engine ====

  * RPG::Weather (RPG::Weather is from RGSS, and should be renamed. RGSS2 naming?)

  * Window_Base
  * Window_ActorTarget (Icon usage missing)
  * Window_Message (Lacks \$, Speed and position based on party on screen)
  * Window_PartyCommand (what is that?)
  * Window_DebugLeft
  * Window_DebugRight
  * Window_PlayTime
  * Window_Steps
  * Window_SaveFile
  * Window_BattleStatus
  * Window_BattleResult

  * Scene_Map?
  * Scene_File
  * Scene_Save
  * Scene_Load
  * Scene_Battle
  * Scene_Name (Done, inputting via keyboard would be nice)
  * Scene_Debug
  * Scene_ActorTarget (Needs spell/item usage)

=== Event commands ===
  * Change Class
  * Show Battle Animation
  * Halt All Movement

==== Graphics ====
  * Cache should be flushed after some map changes. Caching everything wastes too much Ram on some systems.

==== Audio ====
  * Replace Timidity from SDL_Mixer with FluidSynth.

==== Optimizations ====
  * Implement dirty rect system
  * Autotiles should not create their own bitmap.
  * Minimize pixel access. Pre store system values for shadows and backgrounds.

===== Editor =====

==== Config ====
  * Create configuration file to save editor preferences, like last opened project, window and scrollbar positions, etc. (wxFileConfig, .ini backend).

==== Database ====
  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some DialogDb tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fill LDB data from readers library and fill all fields.
  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)

==== Map editor ====
  * Fill LMT data from readers library and fill tree and specific LMT map properties.
  * Fill LMU data from readers library and fill DC canvas layers and map properties.
    * Readapt tilemap layer from player to editor DC.
    * Use wxGLCanvas instead of wxDC? Or both via ifdef?

==== All dialogs ====
  * Make a custom widget (using DC or GLCanvas, like project [[http://slade.mancubus.net/|SLADE]]) to show grid graphics with selector, used in many dialog windows.

==== Writer ====
  * Open discussion topic: http://easy-rpg.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=25
