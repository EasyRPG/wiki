======TODO======
This is the project TODO list.

=====Player2=====

====Current issues====
  * Broken keyboard handling. Random crashes: Crash on release build doing "down, down, up, up, Z". Alt+F4 does not work properly on Win32. F4 on Ubuntu crashes sometimes. Initial high cpu usage. F4 then F4 makes high cpu again and poor responsive arrows.
====Codelite====
  * Update precompiled libraries.
====Reader====
  * Make sure all data chunks are listed correctly.
  * Move the reader into a library (along with a data writer and RPG classes), so Editor and Player can link against it without having duplicated code in both projects.
====Multimedia====
  * Work on a Backend system, specially for Graphics. Common functions should be wrapped, so porting can be easier when the libraries need to be changed.
===Graphics===
  * Implement a dirty rect system, for not redrawing the screen every frame.
  * Implement RPG Maker 2K/2K3 text drawing system (Applying from system graphics a color gradient).
  * Implement sprite rotation. (SDL GFX?)
  * Tilemap.
  * Improve fullscreen.
  * Improve zoom. (Maybe an asm scaler, or work with all bitmaps at x2)
===Audio===
  * Audio cache?
====Engine====
  * Implement diverse classes (Game, Sprite, Window, Scene), too many for listing. Look at RPG Maker XP and VX script for a base.
====Tools====
  * FileFinder: Implement case insensitive search for POSIX.
  * MessageBox: Fix OSX messages, totally untested yet. Verify GTK and Win32 messagebox ports. Implement generic visual messagebox (SDL_picofont?).

===== Editor =====

==== Current issues ====
  * DialogDB crashes when trying to open it after first time.
  * You need to open lmt before open DialogDB, controls should be disabled.

==== All dialogs ====

  * Set minimal window size once the window fits to prevent less size than the minimal fit.

==== Database UI ====

  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)
  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fix memory leak when the dialogDb is opened and related random crashes with the dialogDb preload.
  * Implement all LDB reading into the dialogDb controls.

==== Map editor ====

  * Complete wxTreeCtrl LcfMapTree implementation, missing areas, subtree levels, etc.
  * Fix wxDC map render speed issues. Disable map antialiasing (it happens in wxGTK port) to improve performance (make manual 2X to do this instead of DC zoom). Clip and limit rendering rendering to visible for dramatically render speed up.
  * Implement map properties and fill LMT specific data.
  * Implement event layer on the DC.

==== Reader ====

  * Wait for player2 reader API stabilization and shared library to prevent duplicated reader code.

==== Writer ====

  * Open discussion topic: http://easyrpg.rpgmaker.es/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=25

==== Porting ====

  * Complete Mac OS X Editor CodeLite project configuration (CodeLite 2.6 made changes for .app folder creation and management)

==== Miscellaneous ====

  * Make a custom widget to show grid graphics with selector, used in many dialog windows.
  * Create configuration file to save editor preferences, like window and scrollbar positions.
