==== wxGlade -> wxFormBuilder migration ====

==== General ====
  * Disable controls and import rm2k project selecting folder (or .lmt) instead of loading project directly.

==== Config ====
  * Create configuration file to save editor preferences, like last opened project, window and scrollbar positions, etc. (wxFileConfig, .ini backend).

==== Database ====
  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some DialogDb tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fill LDB data from readers library and fill all fields.
  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)

==== Map editor ====
  * Fill LMT data from readers library and fill tree and specific LMT map properties.
  * Fill LMU data from readers library and fill DC canvas layers and map properties.
    * Readapt tilemap layer from player to editor DC.
    * Use wxGLCanvas instead of wxDC? Or both via ifdef?

==== All dialogs ====
  * Make a custom widget (using DC or GLCanvas, like project [[http://slade.mancubus.net/|SLADE]]) to show grid graphics with selector, used in many dialog windows.

==== Writer ====
