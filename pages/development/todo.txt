====== TODO ======
This is the project TODO list.

Issues for both Player and Editor can be found in the [[http://easyrpg.rpgmaker.es/bugs/|tracker]].

===== Player =====

==== Win32 precompiled libraries ====
  * Update SDL_ttf to 2.0.10 and other libs for MinGW.
  * Compile x64 libs for MSVC.

==== Reader ====
  * Make sure all data chunks are listed correctly.
  * Move the reader into a library (along with a data writer and RPG classes), so Editor and Player can link against it without having duplicated code in both projects.

==== Graphics ====
  * OpenGL
  * Implement zoom for bpp different from 32
  * Implement sprite rotation. (SDL GFX?)
  * Sprite Wave Effect
  * Split Bitmap::TextDraw into smaller functions

=== Audio ===
  * Implement Audio::Pause and Audio::Resume, so it stops playing when game window looses focus.
  * Audio cache?

==== Engine ====
  * Implement diverse classes (Game, Sprite, Window, Scene), too many for listing. Look at RPG Maker XP and VX script for a base.
  * Move to some kind of singleton (or static class?) pattern for Game classes stored in Main_Data. Having to add Main_Data:: isn't that nice.

==== Tools ====
  * MessageBox: Fix OSX port, totally untested yet. Verify Win32 messagebox port.
  * Implement generic in screen message (SDL_picofont?).
  * Improve Filefinder

==== Others ====
  * Unicode support

===== Editor =====

==== All dialogs ====

  * Set minimal window size once the window fits to prevent less size than the minimal fit.

==== Database UI ====

  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)
  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fix memory leak when the dialogDb is opened and related random crashes with the dialogDb preload.
  * Implement all LDB reading into the dialogDb controls.

==== Map editor ====
  * Complete wxTreeCtrl LcfMapTree implementation, missing areas, subtree levels, etc.
  * Fix remaining wxDC map render speed issues. Clip and limit rendering to visible for dramatically render speed up.
  * Implement map properties and fill LMT specific data.
  * Implement event layer on the DC.

==== Reader ====

  * Wait for Player reader API stabilization and shared library to prevent duplicated reader code.

==== Writer ====

  * Open discussion topic: http://easyrpg.rpgmaker.es/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=25

==== Porting ====

  * Complete Mac OS X Editor CodeLite project configuration (CodeLite 2.6 made changes for .app folder creation and management)

==== Miscellaneous ====

  * Make a custom widget to show grid graphics with selector, used in many dialog windows.
  * Create configuration file to save editor preferences, like window and scrollbar positions.
