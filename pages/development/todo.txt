====== TODO ======
This is the project TODO list.

Issues for both Player and Editor can be found in the [[http://easyrpg.rpgmaker.es/bugs/|tracker]].

===== Player =====

==== Win32 precompiled libraries ====
  * Update SDL_ttf to 2.0.10 and other libs for MinGW.
  * Compile x64 libs for MSVC.

==== Reader ====
  * Make sure all data chunks are listed correctly.

==== Graphics ====
  * OpenGL
  * Implement zoom for bpp different from 32
  * Implement sprite rotation. (SDL GFX?)
  * Sprite Wave Effect
  * Split Bitmap::TextDraw into smaller functions

==== Input ====
  * Joystick support

==== Audio ====
  * Implement Audio::Pause and Audio::Resume, so it stops playing when game window looses focus.
  * Audio cache?

==== Engine ====
  * Implement diverse classes (Game, Sprite, Window, Scene), too many for listing. Look at RPG Maker XP and VX script for a base.
  * Move to some kind of singleton (or static class?) pattern for Game classes stored in Main_Data. Having to add Main_Data:: isn't that nice.

==== Tools ====
  * MessageBox: Fix OSX port, totally untested yet.
  * Implement generic in screen message (SDL_picofont?).
  * Improve posix/unix Filefinder

==== Others ====
  * Unicode support


===== Editor =====

==== wxGlade -> wxFormBuilder migration ====
  * Code refactor based in wxFormBuilder C++ style instad of wxGlade C++ style:
    * Export easyrpg.wxg to XRC format, import XRC into wxFormBuilder and regenerate C++
    * Reconnect all windows and put again all not-layout specific code.

==== General ====
  * Disable controls and import rm2k project selecting folder (or .lmt) instead of loading project directly.

==== Config ====
  * Create configuration file to save editor preferences, like last opened project, window and scrollbar positions, etc. (wxFileConfig, .ini backend).

==== Database ====
  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some DialogDb tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fill LDB data from readers library and fill all fields.
  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)

==== Map editor ====
  * Fill LMT data from readers library and fill tree and specific LMT map properties.
  * Fill LMU data from readers library and fill DC canvas layers and map properties.
    * Readapt tilemap layer from player to editor DC.
    * Use wxGLCanvas instead of wxDC? Or both via ifdef?

==== All dialogs ====
  * Set minimal window size once the window fits to prevent less size than the minimal fit (maybe will be fixed with wxFormBuilder migration)
  * Make a custom widget (using DC or GLCanvas, like project [[http://slade.mancubus.net/|SLADE]]) to show grid graphics with selector, used in many dialog windows.

==== Writer ====
  * Open discussion topic: http://easyrpg.rpgmaker.es/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=25

==== Porting ====
  * Mac OS X port. CodeLite build configuration for app bundle.
