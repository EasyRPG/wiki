  * Design and integrate dynamic widgets for some DialogDb tabs (skill type changes some tab controls), replacing nested wxPanels not designed yet.
  * Fill LDB data from readers library and fill all fields.
  * Design missing dialogDb child dialog windows (experience curve and about 30 more)

==== Map editor ====
  * Fill LMT data from readers library and fill tree and specific LMT map properties.

    * Readapt tilemap layer from player to editor DC.
