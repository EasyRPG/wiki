====== Editor code formatting conventions ======

Editor conventions are like player conventions, but with some changes since the editor is written in Vala.

====Naming====
----
==Constants==
All upper case, with underscores as name separators, but no leading/trailing underscores:
<code>THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT</code>

==Type names==
Clases should be UpperCamelCase.
<code>class MainWindow : Gtk.Window {
class Armor : Item {</code>

==Functions==
Functions should be lower case with underscores as word separators. 
<code>void this_is_a_function() {</code>
Properties should have getter and setter defined:
<code>class Foo {
    private int random_int { public get; private set; }
    public bool has_something { public get; public set; }
}</code>

==Variables==
Variables should be lower case with underscores as word separators.
<code>int this_is_a_variable;</code>

====Comments====
----
Use /* This style */ preferably.

==License File Header==
Remember to copy (from any other existing file) the license header to all new created files.

==Special comments==
<code>// TODO: what is left to do
// FIXME: what code and in what circumstances it does not work, and if possible why it does not work well</code>
