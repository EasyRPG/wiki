====== Editor code formatting conventions ======

Editor conventions are like player conventions. Different features come from the nature of GUI objects.

Editor is wxWidgets based. User Interface has a lot of objects related with same thing, for example sizers and other widgets, so Editor uses prefixes for this objects:

Frames: frm. For example, frmEditor.
Dialogs: dlg. For example dlgDatabase.
Sizers: sz. For example szEditorLeft.
...

Each window have a cpp/h pair file, excepting gui_* files, containing more than 1 window class inside.
