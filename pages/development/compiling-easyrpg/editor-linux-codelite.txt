====== Compiling the Editor on GNU/Linux with Codelite ======

===== Things Needed =====

===EasyRPG Source Code===
Kind of obvious as you can't compile something you haven't, check [[development:compiling-easyrpg:getting-sources|]] for more info.

===Codelite===
You can find Codelite [[http://www.codelite.org/|here]].

===Getting the libraries===

This is a list of the packages you need to install:
  * build-essential
  * libwxgtk2.8-dev
  * libwxgtk2.8-dbg

===== Compiling the Editor =====

Open the codelite workspace easyrpg.workspace, then right-click on "editor" in the EasyRPG workspace and select "Set As Active". Then select the "Release" configuration from the workspace view pulldown menu and then go to Build->Build Project, or just press F7 to compile it.

The Editor executable should be in the editor/bin/ folder.
