====== Compiling Player for Nintendo Wii ======

For compiling EasyRPG Player for your Wii you will need [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/|devkitpro]].

And you will need the following libraries:
  * SDL (>=1.2.10).
  * SDL_image (>=1.2.4) with support for BMP, PNG and JPG.
  * SDL_mixer (>=1.2.6) with support for WAV, MIDI, OGG and MP3.
  * SDL_gfx (>=2.0.13).
  * SDL_ttf (>=2.0.7).
Precompiled SDL-libs can be found on the website from [[https://code.google.com/p/sdl-wii/downloads/list|SDL Wii]].
  * Independent JPEG (>=6b  27-Mar-1998).
  * libpng (>=1.2.8).
  * zlib (>=1.2.2).
  * freetype (>=2.4.3).
They can be found in the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/portlibs/|devkitpro portlibs]].

Their are some linker problems with SDL_mixer when ogg is enabled, either try to compile an ogg lib (and link against -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -lvorbisenc -logg) or recompile SDL_mixer without ogg support (remove -DOGG_MUSIC from the Makefile).

For midi you should also patch some lines in the sdl_mixer-timidity-folder (or you will have to put 20mb of "instruments" in the game root):

''common.c:116: (add the lines)''\\
''add_to_pathlist("sd:/data/timidity");''\\
''add_to_pathlist("usb:/data/timidity");''

''config.h:173: (change the lines)''\\
''#define CONFIG_FILE	"sd:/data/timidity/timidity.cfg''\\
''#define CONFIG_FILE_ETC "usb:/data/timidity/timidity.cfg''

Once you have all dependencies above, just type '$ make' in the builds/wii/ directory and it will build the wii.dol. That's all!
