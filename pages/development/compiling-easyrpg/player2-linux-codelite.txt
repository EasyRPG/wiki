====== Compiling Player2 on GNU/Linux with Codelite ======

===== Things Needed =====

===EasyRPG Source Code===
Kind of obvious as you can't compile something you haven't, check [[development:compiling-easyrpg:getting-sources|]] for more info.

===Codelite===
You can find Codelite [[http://www.codelite.org/|here]].

===Getting the libraries===

You will need to install the following packages:
   * build-essential
   * libsdl1.2-dev
   * libsdl-image1.2-dev
   * libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
   * libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
   * libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
   * zlib1g-dev

===== Compiling Player2 =====

Open the codelite workspace easyrpg.workspace, then right-click on "player2" in the EasyRPG workspace and select "Set As Active". Then select the "Release" configuration from the workspace view pulldown menu and then go to Build->Build Project, or just press F7 to compile it.

The Player2 executable should be in the player2/bin/testgame/ folder.
