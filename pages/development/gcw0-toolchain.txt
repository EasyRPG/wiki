====== Building the GCW Zero Toolchain ======

For our [[https://easy-rpg.org/jenkins/|Jenkins build server]] we needed a modified toolchain, that does not depend to be installed in ''/opt''.
The following instructions have been written along the way and should result in a working toolchain that is suitable to get a working EasyRPG Player build.

First, we need the buildroot from GitHub and change into the directory:

<code bash>
git clone https://github.com/gcwnow/buildroot.git
cd buildroot
</code>

To use the default configuration:

<code bash>
make gcw0_defconfig
</code>

**Optionally**, we can use a previously saved config file, just copy it to ''.config''.
We need to add newly available options then:
<code bash>
make oldconfig
</code>

We configure the packages to be build and available options:
<code bash>
make menuconfig
</code>
There are also the graphical frontends ''xconfig'', using qt and ''gconfig'', using gtk.

Most of the libraries are not needed, so we disable them to save some time while compiling.
Needed libraries are ''sdl'', ''sdl_mixer'' and ''icu''.

Now the important step: change the toolchain directory from ''/opt/gcw0-toolchain'' to your desired directory.
(''BR2_HOST_DIR="/home/jenkins/gcw0-toolchain"'')

To speed up the build further, set the parallel make jobs to the cores of your cpu
(''BR2_JLEVEL=2'')

To speed up possibly rebuilds, enable ''ccache''.
(''BR2_CCACHE=y'' and ''BR2_CCACHE_DIR="$(HOME)/.buildroot-ccache"'')

When all things are set up, we can start the build and get something to drink in the meanwhile =)
<code bash>
nice -n19 make
</code>

Afterwards, there should be a new, shiny toolchain in the directory you chose.
