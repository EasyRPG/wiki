====== Building liblcf with CMake ======

===== CMake Requirements =====
  * make
  * CMake 2.8 or later
  * pkg-config
  * ICU
  * expat

===== Build =====
  * Run "cmake ${PATH TO liblcf/builds/cmake} && make".
  * If you want to build it with debug mode pass "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" to cmake. Debug mode will generate a file larger than usual.

After this, a liblcf.a file will be generated.
