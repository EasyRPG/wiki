===== Compiling Editor =====

Open the solution file in editor\builds\vs2010 , select the "Release" configuration and the target architecture (Win32 or x86) from the configuration manager pulldown menu (use Win32 if you are unsure). Then go to Build->Build solution, or just press Control-F7 to compile it.

The Editor executable should be in the folder bin\Editor.exe. If you are not using the precompiled libraries, and you have dynamically linked Editor, you will need to place the required .dll in the same folder Editor.exe is.
