====== Building Readers with CMake ======

===== General Requirements =====
  * [[./requirements]]

===== CMake Requirements =====
  * CMake 2.8 or greater

===== Build =====
  * Run "cmake ${PATH TO readers/builds/cmake} && make".
  * If you want to build it with debug mode pass "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" to cmake. Debug mode will generate a file larger than usual.

After this, a libreaders.a file will be generated.
