====== Building Readers with GNU Build System ======

===== Requirements =====
  * GNU Autoconf 2.68 or greater
  * GNU Automake 1.11 or greater
  * GNU iconv (already included in most distributions) (Not required for Windows)
  * GNU Gettext development files (Required for iconv detecion)
  * Boost (Not required for Windows)
  * Expat (optional for XML reader support)

More information at [[./requirements]]

===== Build =====

  * Run ''./autogen.sh && ./configure %%--%%prefix=$PWD/build && make && make install''

After this, there will be a libreaders.a in the $PWD/build folder

Currently, this library is statically built by default. This is expected to be improved for better distro packaging (add support for libtool and pkg-config).

  ''sudo apt-get -y install %%--%%no-install-recommends git make automake g++ gettext libboost-dev && mkdir EasyRPG && cd EasyRPG && git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Readers.git && cd Readers && ./autogen.sh && ./configure %%--%%prefix=$PWD/build && make && make install''
  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Readers'' folder -> ''build'' folder -> ''lib'' folder. If there is a ''libreaders.a'' file inside, your Readers library setup is OK.
