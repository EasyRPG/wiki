====== Compiling Player for GCW Zero ======

You need to setup the gcw0 buildroot first: Download a precompiled toolchain from [[http://www.gcw-zero.com/develop]].

[[development:gcw0-toolchain#cross-compile-pixman|You need to cross-compile pixman]].

Download Player and liblcf from GitHub:

<code bash>
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git
cd Player/libs
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/EasyRPG/liblcf.git
cd ..
</code>

Change into the ''builds/opendingux'' folder and start the build:

<code bash>
cd builds/opendingux
make
</code>

If no error occured, there will be an EasyRPG executable in the ''gcw-zero'' subdirectory.
To build an opk ready to deploy to the device:

<code bash>
cd gcw-zero
./opk_build.sh
</code>
