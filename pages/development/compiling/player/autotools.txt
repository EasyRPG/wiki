====== Building Player with GNU Build System ======

===== Requirements =====
  * Make
  * SDL2 (or SDL 1.2, discouraged)
  * SDL2_mixer (or SDL_Mixer 1.2, discouraged)
  * Freetype
  * Pixman
  * libpng
  * zlib
  * boost
  * [[../readers/autotools|EasyRPG Readers library]]

===== Build =====
  * Run ''./configure CPPFLAGS="-D//UNIX// -D//HAVE_WINE//" && make && make install''

For other systems, replace ''-D//UNIX//'' for your platform, for example, ''-D//_WIN32//'' if you are using Windows. See ''src/system.h'' file for details.

If you want to cross compile with a specific gcc toolchain, pass ''%%--%%host=//whatever//'' to ''configure''.

For most games, you will need to have installed the RTP. To install RTP in UNIX you can use WINE. EasyRPG Player will detect the RTP path from the WINE registry automatically. Will work with original Japanese RTP filenames even when games are created with English RTP translations (Don Miguel, RPG Advocate) and vice-versa. Read [[/user/player/rtp]] to learn how to install the RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 RTPs.

If you don't want to use WINE to check RTP installation you can remove the ''-D//HAVE_WINE//'' part. To set up RTP folders by hand, read [[/user/player/rtp]] to do it.

===== Step by step setup for Debian based distros (gNewSense, Trisquel, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu...) =====
  * Do the [[../readers/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:
  ''sudo apt-get -y install %%--%%no-install-recommends libboost-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libpixman-1-dev libfreetype6-dev && cd ~/EasyRPG && git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git && cd Player && ./autogen.sh && ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DUNIX CXXFLAGS=-I$PWD/../Readers/build/include LDFLAGS=-L$PWD/../Readers/build/lib LIBS=-lreaders && make''
  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player executable has been successfully built.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.

Note: for Trisquel, replace the following words in the text above: ''libboost-dev'' with ''libboost1.48-dev''

Note: if you compiled readers with ''%%--%%enable-xml'' then replace ''LIBS=-lreaders'' with ''LIBS="-lreaders -lexpat"''

Note: For Trisquel and Debian 7 will need SDL2 and SDL2_mixer packages from testing (jessie) or replace ''libsdl2-mixer-dev'' with ''libsdl-mixer1.2-dev'' (fallback to SDL 1.2).

===== Step by step setup for Fedora =====

  * Do the [[../readers/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:
  ''sudo yum -y install boost-devel SDL2_mixer-devel pixman-devel freetype-devel libpng-devel && cd ~/EasyRPG && git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git && cd Player && ./autogen.sh && ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DUNIX CXXFLAGS=-I$PWD/../Readers/build/include LDFLAGS=-L$PWD/../Readers/build/lib LIBS=-lreaders && make''
  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player setup is OK.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.

Note: if you compiled readers with ''%%--%%enable-xml'' then replace ''LIBS=-lreaders'' with ''LIBS="-lreaders -lexpat"''
