====== Building Player with GNU Build System ======

===== Requirements =====
  * g++ or clang
  * make
  * pkg-config
  * boost (only headers needed) >= 1.48
  * [[../liblcf/autotools|liblcf]]
  * libpng
  * FreeType
  * Pixman
  * SDL2 (or SDL 1.2, discouraged)
  * SDL2_mixer (or SDL_Mixer 1.2, discouraged)
  * zlib

===== Requirements for building from git =====
  * autoconf >= 2.69
  * automake >= 1.11.4
  * git
Run ''autoreconf -i'' to generate the ''configure'' script.

===== Build =====
  * Run:

  ./configure
  make

Once compiled, copy or symlink the ''easyrpg-player'' file from the ''src/'' folder into a game folder (same place as ''RPG_RT.exe'') and run it from its folder with ''./easyrpg-player''
===== RTP support with WINE =====

For most games, you will need to have installed the RTP. To install RTP in non-Windows systems you can use WINE. EasyRPG Player will detect the RTP path from the WINE registry automatically. Will work with original Japanese RTP filenames even when games are created with English RTP translations (Don Miguel, RPG Advocate) and vice-versa. Read [[/user/player/rtp]] to learn how to install the RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 RTPs.

===== Step by step setup for Debian based distros (gNewSense, Trisquel, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu...) =====
  * Do the [[../liblcf/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:

  sudo apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends libboost-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libpixman-1-dev
  cd ~/EasyRPG
  git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make

  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player executable has been successfully built.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.

===== Step by step setup for Fedora =====

  * Do the [[../liblcf/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:

  sudo yum -y install boost-devel SDL2_mixer-devel pixman-devel libpng-devel
  cd ~/EasyRPG
  git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure

  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player executable has been successfully built.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.
