====== Building Player with GNU Build System ======

===== Requirements =====
  * Make
  * SDL 1.2
  * SDL_mixer
  * Freetype
  * Pixman
  * libpng
  * zlib
  * boost
  * [[../readers/autotools|EasyRPG Readers library]]

===== Build =====
  * Run ''./configure CPPFLAGS=-D//UNIX// && make && make install''

For other systems, replace ''-D//UNIX//'' for your platform, for example, ''-D//_WIN32//'' if you are using Windows. See ''src/system.h'' file for details.

If you want to cross compile with a specific gcc toolchain, pass ''%%--%%host=//whatever//'' to ''configure''.

===== Step by step setup for Debian based distros (gNewSense, Trisquel, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu...) =====
  * Do the [[../readers/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:
  ''sudo apt-get -y install %%--%%no-install-recommends libboost-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libpixman-1-dev libfreetype6-dev libjpeg8-dev && cd ~/EasyRPG && git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git && cd Player && ./autogen.sh && ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DUNIX CXXFLAGS=-I$PWD/../Readers/build/include LDFLAGS=-L$PWD../Readers/build/lib LIBS=-lreaders && make''
  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player setup is OK.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.

Note: for Trisquel, replace the following words in the text above: ''libboost-dev'' with ''libboost1.48-dev''

Note: if you compiled readers with '%%--%%enable-xml' then replace ''LIBS=-lreaders'' with ''LIBS="-lreaders -lexpat"''

===== Step by step setup for Fedora =====

  * Do the [[../readers/autotools]] setup first
  * Open the Terminal application
  * Copy the following text and paste it in your terminal window and press the enter key, you will need to enter your password and press again the enter key:
  ''sudo yum -y install boost-devel SDL_mixer-devel pixman-devel freetype-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel && cd ~/EasyRPG && git clone https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player.git && cd Player && ./autogen.sh && ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DUNIX CXXFLAGS=-I$PWD/../Readers/build/include LDFLAGS=-L$PWD../Readers/build/lib LIBS=-lreaders && make''
  * Go to your Files application and browse into ''EasyRPG'' folder -> ''Player'' folder -> ''src'' folder. If there is a ''easyrpg-player'' file inside, your Player setup is OK.
  * Move the ''easyrpg-player'' file into a game folder (same place as RPG_RT.exe) and run it to play the game.

Note: if you compiled readers with '%%--%%enable-xml' then replace ''LIBS=-lreaders'' with ''LIBS="-lreaders -lexpat"''
