====== Editor ======

{{indexmenu>:development:editor|nojs dsort}}

Editor is the graphical tool to create games, equivalent to RPG2000.exe or RPG2003.exe editor programs of RPG Maker 2000/2003.

The EasyRPG editor wants to be closer to the RPG Maker 200X interface but not identical and with same features (but at least), capable to import RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games and saving the projects with a new, extensible format with more features and supported by the EasyRPG player.

===== Project status =====

Editor depends on the design XML file format. Basic XML open/save feature is on the way for. Editor will not import directly RPG Maker 200x files, will use an external file converter.
