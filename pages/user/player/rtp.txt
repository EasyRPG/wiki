====== Runtime Package (RTP) ======

EasyRPG does not provide a complete RTP yet, search the internet for the official RPG2000 and RPG2003 RTP.

The RTP contains graphics and sounds that are used by many games. The better games usually don't need any files from the RTP.

Depending on the operating system you have to take care on a few steps:

==== Windows ====

Just install the RTP using the official installer, the Player will automatically find it (by reading the Windows registry).

==== Linux, MacOS and other systems ====

The RTP is found by reading environment variables:

  * ''RPG2K_RTP_PATH'': For the RPG2000 RTP
  * ''RPG2K3_RTP_PATH'': For the RPG2003 RTP
  * ''RPG_RTP_PATH'': For any RTP (fallback if 2k or 2k3 variable is missing)

If your system does not support environment variables you can place the RTP in the folders ''/data/rtp/2000'' and ''/data/rtp/2003'' instead. 

==== Wii ====

Extract the RTP into ''/data/rtp/2000'' and ''/data/rtp/2003'' (SD and USB are supported).
