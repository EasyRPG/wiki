====== Special Features ======

This site lists all changes that are different to the original RPG_RT.

===== Support for games of any language =====

The original RPG_RT has problems handling games from countries that use characters which are not in the current codepage of the system.

Example: If you life in England your (Windows) system has the codepage for Western European (1252) set. With this codepage it's not possible to play Russian or Japanese games because their characters are not encoded in this codepage. This problem applies to all older applications that are not Unicode aware. Unicode is an encoding that provides a mapping for all characters used in the world.

The EasyRPG Player is of course unicode aware but you have to hint him, what encoding the game uses. This is done by editing the RPG_RT.ini in the game folder and adding the following entry:

''[EasyRPG]\\
Encoding=####
''

#### must be replaced by a number that specifes the codepage:

^ Name      ^ Number      ^ Use for      ^
| Western European    | 1252 |  English games or games from most European countries |
| Windows-1251    | 1251 | Russian games (with cyrillic letters)|
| Shift-JIS    | 932     | Japanese games (with Hiragana, Katakana or Kanji) |
