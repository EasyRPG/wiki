Extract the binary into the game folder and execute it. It behaves the same as RPG_RT with the exception, that RPG2k and RPG2k3 games are automatically detected, so one executable works for all games (as long as they are supported).

Most RPG Maker 2000/2003 games requires RTP. See [[rtp]] for installation instructions.
