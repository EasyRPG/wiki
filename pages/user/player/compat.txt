====== Game Compatibility List ======

While most games work out of the box to a certain degree, some may need additional setup or have quirks.
Especially, custom [[user:player:patches|patches]] that are applied to the interpreter (RPG_RT.exe) itself, are mostly unsupported.
This list is by no means complete, but merely lists games that have been tried by the EasyRPG developers and users.
