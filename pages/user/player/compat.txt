====== Game Compatibility List ======

While most games work out of the box to a certain degree, some may need additional setup or have quirks.
Especially, custom [[user:player:patches|patches]] that are applied to the interpreter (RPG_RT.exe) itself, are mostly unsupported.
This list is by no means complete, but merely lists games that have been tried by the EasyRPG developers and users.

When a game is marked as //completable// means somebody played it with Player and was able to complete it with it.

When a game is marked as //playable// means somebody played it with Player but maybe didn't finish it yet, though it might be completable, it is just unconfirmed.
