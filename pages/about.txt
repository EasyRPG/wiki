====== About EasyRPG ======

EasyRPG is a project to create a free (as in freedom) Role Playing Game (RPG) creation tool.

The project consists on several tools and resources:

  * EasyRPG Editor
  * EasyRPG Player
  * RTP Replacement

It is inspired on a commercial product called **RPG Maker**.

===== EasyRPG Editor =====

The Editor is an application with an user interface to design roleplaying games.

It consists on:

  * A main **map editor** window where you can draw tile based maps
  * A **database** window dialog where you can create or customize your characters, habilities, enemies, terrains, etc.
  * Window dialogs to edit map properties, trigger battles every steps on map, etc.
  * Window dialogs to add and manage map **events**, to handle commands for this events, display NPCs, messages etc.


===== EasyRPG Player =====

The **Player** is an application to run games made with EasyRPG Editor.

Also it can **play RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games** directly (RPG_RT.exe equivalent). This is the main feature in development currently.

EasyRPG Player is very portable. This allows to play games in a lot of systems: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, video game consoles and mobile phones.


===== RTP Replacement =====

The original RPG Maker software is not free. RPG Maker includes a shared material **library with graphics and sounds**, used by most games made with this software, called **Run Time Package** (RTP). This material can be distributed only with games made with RPG Maker and only by their customers, so these games are depending on a material distribution only available on Japanese Windows Platforms in the case of RPG Maker 2000 and 2003.

So if you are using RPG Maker and you want to play a game made with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 witch they are depending on RTP files, you need a RTP replacement due to license restrictions in the original RTP.

To learn more about RTP replacement you can visit the [[./development/rtp-replacement]] development page.
