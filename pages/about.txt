====== About EasyRPG ======

EasyRPG is a project to create a free (as in freedom) Role Playing Game (RPG) creation tool.

  * A main map editor window where you can draw tile based maps
  * A data base window dialog where you can create or customize your characters, habilities, enemies, terrains, etc.
  * Window dialogs to edit map properties, trigger battles every steps on map, etc.
  * Window dialogs to add and manage map events, to handle commands for this events, display NPCs, messages etc.


===== EasyRPG Player =====

The Player is an application to run games made with EasyRPG Editor.

Also it can play RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games directly (RPG_RT.exe equivalent). This is the main feature in development currently.

EasyRPG Player is very portable. This allows to play games in a lot of systems: GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, video game consoles and mobile phones.
