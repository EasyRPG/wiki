====== RTP replacement ======

Most games made with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 make use of a media resources library, containing graphics, music and sounds, called "Run-Time Package" (RTP). Those data is often a game dependency, not include with the game data, designed for the common usage of materials. But this data is not free. To make it free (as freedom), we need a free replacement to guarantee the free distribution (if the rest of the game data is free), compatibility and execution of those games.
