====== Editor ======

Editor is the graphical tool to create games, equivalent to RPG2000.exe or RPG2003.exe editor programs of RPG Maker 2000/2003.

The EasyRPG editor wants to be closer to the RPG Maker 200X interface but not identical and with same features (but at least), capable to import RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games and saving the projects with a new, extensible format with more features and supported by the EasyRPG player.

===== Project status =====
Editor now needs to work on the RPG Maker 2000 data reading to fill the database fields to ensure readers are OK. Some dialogs still need to be designed.
