====== Player ======

The Player is the game interpreter of games made with RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 editors. Technically, the player is the replacement of the RPG_RT.exe program executable and runtime interpreter of RPG Maker, distributed with games.

===== Project status =====

The player reached certain game emulation, supporting map events, all map layers and some map event commands but the code became a mess. The repository opened a new folder called "player2" and the effort is centered on a complete rewrite of the player, featuring new class structure, inspired on RGSS and RGSS2 API, used on RPG Maker XP and VX scripting system.

The motivation for the adoption of the RGSS style is because is a valid design and closer to the RPG Maker 2000/2003 requirements, so the class design is already done. Furthermore, RGSS became popular between RPG Maker developers, so is a good chance for the RPG Maker users to take a step and contribute directly to the player development.

Currently the player2 development branch still needs to render maps, but a lot of work is done around the graphics, sound and other relevant internal classes (the not-RGSS style part).

===== Current maintainers =====

''vgvgf'' is the current main developer of EasyRPG player and he made the most rewrite of the player2 branch.
