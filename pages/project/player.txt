====== Player ======

The Player is the game interpreter of games made with RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 editors. Technically, the player is the replacement of the RPG_RT.exe program executable and runtime interpreter of RPG Maker, distributed with games.

===== Project status =====

Currently the Player development can render full upper and lower layer maps, play some transitions, text rendering, window showing, playing sound and other relevant internal classes (the not-RGSS style part). A few RGSS inspired classes work is done, too.
