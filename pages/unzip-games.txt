====== Unzip games with specific encodings ======

Some games are distributed in .zip packages. Lots of these have file names with non-ASCII encoding characters.

Most zip files are not using Unicode, so they need a special procedure to be unpacked properly.

===== Unpack and convert from GNU/Linux and other UNIX =====

Requirements:
  * Installed locales for languages to decode.
  * ''p7zip-full''
  * ''convmv''

Commands for specific encodings:

==== Japanese ====

  LANG=ja_JP 7za x filename.zip
  cd gamefolder
  convmv --notest -f shiftjis -t utf8 -r *

==== Traditional Chinese (Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao...) ====

  LANG=zh_HK 7za x filename.zip
  cd gamefolder
  convmv --notest -f cp950 -t utf8 -r *

Alternatively, ''zh_TW'' and other should work fine too.
