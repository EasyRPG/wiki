# Behavior of Common Events Called in RPG Maker 2003 Battle

Backup from <https://web.archive.org/web/20080325201903/http://www.phylomortis.com/html/battlece.html>

In RPG Maker 2003, common events can be called in battle. However, the behavior of some of the events is abnormal. The following table describes the effect of each event when called in battle. "Normal" means it has the effect you would expect. Otherwise, the actual effect will be described.

This list is current as of RPG Maker 2003 version 1.09. Some events did not behave as described in earlier versions.

| Call Event                       | \* Common Events are called normally. Map event calls are made to the event with the specified ID on the map where the battle is taking place. Even if a map event is called, it is treated as though it was a common event for this purpose. For instance, if a "show message" event is contained within the called map event, the message will be shown in the battle itself |
