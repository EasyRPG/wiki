# Audio Backend

The Player is currently using SDL_Mixer as the default audio backend.

## Available Backends

-   [SDL Mixer](/development/player/audio-backend/sdl-mixer)
-   [Open AL](/development/player/audio-backend/open-al)

## API

The main header of the audio backend is `audio.h`.

TODO: Generate a doc using doxygen (+ improve documentation of sourcecode) and link it here.
