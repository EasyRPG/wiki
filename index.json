project consists on several tools and resources:\n EasyRPG Editor EasyRPG Player RTP Replacement  It is inspired on a commercial product called RPG Maker.\nEasyRPG Editor The Editor is an application with a user interface to design roleplaying games.\nIt consists on:\n A main map editor window where you can draw tile based maps A database window dialog where you can create or customize your characters, abilities, enemies, terrains, etc. Window dialogs to edit map properties, trigger battles every steps on map, etc. Window dialogs to add and manage map events, to handle commands for this events, display NPCs, messages etc.  EasyRPG Player The Player is an application to run games made with EasyRPG Editor.\nAlso it can play RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games directly (RPG_RT.exe equivalent). This is the main feature in development currently.\nEasyRPG Player is very portable. This allows to play games in a lot of systems: GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, video game consoles and mobile phones.\nRTP Replacement The original RPG Maker software is not free. RPG Maker includes a shared material library with graphics and sounds, used by most games made with this software, called Run Time Package (RTP). This material can be distributed only with games made with RPG Maker and only by their customers, so these games are depending on a material distribution only available on Japanese Windows Platforms in the case of RPG Maker 2000 and 2003.\nSo if you are using RPG Maker and you want to play a game made with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 which they are depending on RTP files, you need a RTP replacement due to license restrictions in the original RTP.\nTo learn more about RTP replacement you can visit the ./development/rtp-replacement development page.\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/compiling/player/android/","title":"android","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Building/working on the Android Port Note : We recommend you to put the \u0026ldquo;android-toolchain\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;player\u0026rdquo; directories in the same directory.\n1) Build the android port a) Install the Android SDK Download and follow the official instructions to install the Android SDK : http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools\nIn the SDK directory, execute the \u0026ldquo;android\u0026rdquo; file, it displays a GUI.

However, the behavior of some of the events is abnormal. The following table describes the effect of each event when called in battle. \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; means it has the effect you would expect. Otherwise, the actual effect will be described.\nThis list is current as of RPG Maker 2003 version 1.09. Some events did not behave as described in earlier versions.\n   Event Command Behavior     Message Normal   Message Display Options * This command will change the message style for non-battle messages, but battle messages are always displayed at the top of the screen and cannot be made transparent   Face Graphics Normal   Show Choices Normal   Input Number Normal   Switch Operations Normal   Variable Operations Normal   Timer Operations * Normal, but when starting the timer with \u0026ldquo;show timer onscreen\u0026rdquo; checked and \u0026ldquo;timer runs during battle\u0026rdquo; unchecked, it may look like the command was unsuccessful. It works, but with these conditions, won\u0026rsquo;t give any overt confirmation of its success until the battle is over   Change Money Normal   Item Management Normal   Change Party Normal   Change Experience Points Normal   Change Character Level Normal   Change Character Base Statistics Normal   Change Skills Normal   Change Equipped Items Normal   Change Character HP Normal   Change Character MP Normal   Change Character Condition Normal   Complete Healing Normal   Simulated Enemy Attack Normal   Change Hero Name Normal   Change Hero Title Normal   Change Sprite Association Normal   Change Face Association Normal   Change Vehicle Graphic Normal   Change System BGM * Normal, except that if the system BGM for battle is changed, the new battle music will not begin playing immediately, though it will at the beginning of the next battle   Change System Sound Effects Normal   Change System Graphics Normal   Set Screen Transitions Normal   Enemy Encounter * Crashes the game   Open Shop Window * The shop will be shown, but when the shop screen is closed, the battle ends with the battle music still playing   Show Inn Message Normal   Enter Hero Name * The Enter Hero Name screen is shown, but due to a font compatibility issue, Enter Hero Name doesn\u0026rsquo;t work properly when running RM2K3 on English-language systems. Therefore, it cannot be tested fully   Teleport * The teleport is shown briefly, and then the battle resumes normally   Memorize Position Normal   Recall to Memorized Position * The same result as Teleport, described above   Enter or Exit Vehicle * Ignored   Set Vehicle Start Position Normal   Change Event Location * The event with the ID you specify on the map where the battle is taking place is moved to the location you specify. Although it works, it\u0026rsquo;s impractical in most circumstances   Trade Two Event Locations * Similar to \u0026ldquo;Set Event Location\u0026rdquo;   Set Terrain ID * Operates on the map where the battle is taking place   Store Event ID * Operates on the map where the battle is taking place   Hide Screen Normal   Show Screen Normal   Tint Screen Normal   Flash Screen Normal   Shake Screen Normal   Pan Screen * The operation occurs on the map after the battle concludes   Weather Effects Normal   Show Picture * The picture is shown on the map where the battle took place at the end of the battle   Move Picture * If a picture corresponding to the picture number to be moved is displayed on the map where the battle took place at the end of the battle, the move operation is performed on that picture at the end of the battle   Erase Picture * If a picture corresponding to the picture number to be erased is displayed on the map where the battle took place at the end of the battle, the erasure is performed on that picture at the end of the battle   Show Battle Animation * Note that this is the map event version, so it cannot be used to show battle animations on the battle screen itself. The end result is that the battle animation will not be shown   Hero Sprite Transparency Normal   Flash Sprite * Ignored   Move Event * The event with the ID you specify is moved on the map where the battle took place at the end of the battle. Only one move event can be pending in this way   Proceed with Movement * Ignored   Halt All Movement * Ignored   Wait * Waiting for a specific amount of time works normally, but \u0026ldquo;wait until key pressed\u0026rdquo; will cause the battle to freeze   Play BGM Normal   Fade BGM Normal   Memorize BGM Normal   Play Memorized BGM Normal   Play Sound Effect Normal   Play Movie * The movie plays after the battle.   Key Input Processing * When not using the \u0026ldquo;wait until key pressed\u0026rdquo; option, it works normally. However, if you try to detect a key pressed with this option checked, the battle will freeze   Change Map Tileset * The change takes place on the map where the battle took place   Change Parallax Background * The change takes place on the map where the battle took place   Change Encounter Rate * The change takes place on the map where the battle took place   Tile Substitution * The change takes place on the map where the battle took place   Teleport Target Management Normal   Allow/Disallow Teleport Normal   Set Escape Target Normal   Allow/Disallow Escape Normal   Open Save Menu * The save menu is shown normally. However, when the save menu is closed, the battle ends with the battle music still playing   Allow/Disallow Saving Normal   Open Main Menu * The menu is shown normally. However, when the menu is closed, the battle ends with the battle music still playing   Allow/Disallow Main Menu Normal   Conditional Branch Normal   Label Normal   Jump to Label Normal   Loop Normal   Break out of Loop Normal   End Event Processing Normal   Erase Event Normal   Call Event * Common Events are called normally. Map event calls are made to the event with the specified ID on the map where the battle is taking place. Even if a map event is called, it is treated as though it was a common event for this purpose. For instance, if a \u0026ldquo;show message\u0026rdquo; event is contained within the called map event, the message will be shown in the battle itself   Insert Comment \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;   Game Over Normal   Return to Title Screen Normal   Change Class * Normal, but be aware that using this event command causes all the character\u0026rsquo;s equipment to be unequipped, so some extra coding will be required to make it work smoothly in battle   Change Battle Commands Normal    "},{"uri":"/wiki/compiling/editor-gtk/cmake/","title":"Building Editor-GTK with CMake","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Requirements  cmake-2.8 or greater GTK+ 3.4 or greater Vala compiler 0.16 or greater  Build  Run \u0026ldquo;cmake ${PATH TO editor/builds/cmake} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make\u0026rdquo;.

The following instructions have been written along the way and should result in a working toolchain that is suitable to get a working EasyRPG Player build.\nPrerequisites: I assume you do all the steps in a seperate build directory to not interfere with old toolchains and other stuff. Also you need some development tools installed on your machine, for example gcc, make and subversion. The buildroot will warn you, when you forgot to install something, though.\nFirst, we need the buildroot from GitHub and change into the directory:\ngit clone https://github.com/gcwnow/buildroot.git cd buildroot To use the default configuration:\nmake gcw0_defconfig Optionally, we can use a previously saved config file, just copy it to .config. We need to add newly available options then:\nmake oldconfig We configure the packages to be build and available options:\nmake menuconfig There are also the graphical frontends xconfig, using qt and gconfig, using gtk.\nMost of the libraries and stuff under \u0026ldquo;Target Packages\u0026rdquo; are not needed, so we disable them to save some time while compiling. Needed libraries are sdl, sdl_mixer and icu.\nNow the important step: change the toolchain directory from /opt/gcw0-toolchain to your desired directory under \u0026ldquo;Build Options\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Host Dir\u0026rdquo;. (BR2_HOST_DIR=\u0026quot;/home/jenkins/gcw0-toolchain\u0026quot; in .config)\nTo speed up the build further, set the parallel make jobs to the cores of your cpu \u0026ldquo;Number of jobs to run simultaneously (0 for auto)\u0026rdquo;. (BR2_JLEVEL=2 in .config)\nTo speed up possibly rebuilds, enable ccache \u0026ldquo;Enable compiler cache\u0026rdquo;. (BR2_CCACHE=y and BR2_CCACHE_DIR=\u0026quot;$(HOME)/.buildroot-ccache\u0026quot; in .config)\nWhen all things are set up, we can start the build and get something to drink in the meanwhile =)\nnice -n19 make Afterwards, there should be a new, shiny toolchain in the directory you chose.\nCross-compile pixman Pixman is a needed library and not part of the toolchain.\nDownload the latest release and extract it.\nThen it is the normal auto-tools-based build steps:\ncd pixman-*/ ./configure --host=mipsel-linux --prefix=/usr make make DESTDIR=/home/jenkins/gcw0-toolchain/usr/mipsel-gcw0-linux-uclibc/sysroot/ install Be sure to install it in the sysroot directory to ensure it is found when compiling target packages.\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/user/player/buttons/","title":"Button mapping","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The buttons are mapped similiar to the original RPG_RT but EasyRPG Player additionally provides more functions.\nNormal Keys    Buttons Function     Up, K, Num8, W Move up   Down, J, Num2, S Move down   Left, H, Num4, A Move left   Right, L, Num6, D Move right   Enter, Z, Y, Space, Num Enter Actions (Select menu item and talk to NPCs)   Esc, Backspace, X, C, V, B, N, Num0 Cancel (Open menu and cancel actions)   Page down Scroll down one page in selection dialogs   Page up Scroll up one page in selection dialogs    Game specific keys These keys have game specific functions.

An exception could be .cpp static functions or variables, if documenting is really necessary.\nCode descriptions We prefer a global function description with Doxygen headers rather than inside the function descriptions. Only when code is really hard to follow, or there is something hardcoded then add some comments explaining the situation.

This means that all assets like pictures and music must be fetched asynchronously. When the Player wants to display a new graphic it will appear on the desktop versions (Windows, Linux, Android, \u0026hellip;) immediately but on the web it will be invisible while the file is downloaded. Once the downloaded finishes it is replaced with the real image.\nIn contrast to images and music some files are important to continue execution. When a map file is pending the Player will halt until the file is downloaded. The first halt is while the Logo is displayed on startup, it downloads the database and the maptree here. Download of map files is blocking, too. But this is usually not noticeable because the download is executed while the fade out animation plays (it will stay black when the map downloading takes longer then this).\nHosting your own games Hosting your own games is quite simple. Just follow these steps.\nDeploying the Player on your server Download this archive and extract it on your server.\nYou will get the following files and folder:\n index.html index.wasm index.js games/  If you want to try it locally you need a HTTP server. Just opening the index.html in your browser will not work. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a local webserver the simplest way is installing Python and running python -m http.server. Then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser and navigate to your directory.\nDeploying a game on your server Because RPG Maker games refer to files without extension and querying the server for every supported extension would be slow, you need to run a small tool to generate a file called index.json (containing an game file list index with extensions) for every game before uploading. The tool is called gencache.\nYou can get the tool here:\n    Place the gencache executable in a game working folder (the folder containing RPG_RT.* files) to generate the index.json. Move the gencache executable to working folders for each game you want to upload and run gencache again to generate the index.json for them. Once finished you can remove (don\u0026rsquo;t upload it, it\u0026rsquo;s not needed) the gencache from any game folder.\nYour games are expected in subdirectories of the games directory. The default game executed is the one in games/default. You can create further games by just by putting them in subdirectories of the games directory.\nNow access the index.html file and your default game should start.

If you\u0026rsquo;re worried about having to share the source code because EasyRPG is open-source, you\u0026rsquo;ve been mistaken! Software that\u0026rsquo;s made with open-source compilers can be sold without having to share the source code. If that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case, that would ruin a lot of businesses. Ren\u0026rsquo;Py is an example of an open-source engine that currently has games being sold on it. Aside from the tutorial, name one game that has its source available.\nThe free software conditions make it so that when you modify EasyRPG\u0026ndash; not your game\u0026ndash; you would have to share whatever changes you made to EasyRPG, and luckily our editor doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold you to that. If you have to modify EasyRPG for your game, you will need to include what you changed along with the game\u0026rsquo;s package (on the web or by retail box).\nThis does not mean you transfer your game\u0026rsquo;s copyrights to anyone else! You still hold it, because you made it. You\u0026rsquo;re not obligated to release it under the same license.\nCan I distribute a game I made with RTP replacement material? Yes, but you would need to share the RTP replacement parts including their license(s).\nWhat if I modify RTP replacement material for my game? Then you would have to release it under the same share-alike license. You can only get the full rights when your derivative is not actually a derivative. Alternatively, you can look to the public domain or Creative Commons Attribution-licensed materials. The CC BY license only requires attribution (giving credit).\nWhat rights are protected when I release a game? When does someone violate them? The rights to your own assets. Free and open source components are not entirely yours, and any user who has used those components have not violated your rights. These components can be the EasyRPG Player, RTP replacement material or for derivatives if they use the CC BY-SA license, and it\u0026rsquo;s within legal bounds because it\u0026rsquo;s permitted by the license. Any user that has taken what is clearly your own original materials could be infringing your rights.\nIs it possible to have the RTP replacement\u0026rsquo;s share-alike requirement waivered upon request? That is up to their author to decide. Get in contact with them, and they can discuss custom licensing with you.\nCan I sell EasyRPG itself? Yes. Just be sure to include any changes you\u0026rsquo;ve made to the source code if any.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using a modified editor that has no effect on the EasyRPG Player. Is it still possible to distribute my game without having to share the source code of the modified editor? It\u0026rsquo;s considered good practice to share changes with the community, but you\u0026rsquo;re not obligated to share your changes if the Player\u0026rsquo;s binary doesn\u0026rsquo;t change. You could link to the EasyRPG site that includes the binaries and source; it\u0026rsquo;s typically found at the homepage.\nAbout the player Will this game work with EasyRPG? We want 100% compatibility with RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games so that when they run on the original engines, they also run here. Any game or feature in a game that does not work in EasyRPG when it does in RPG Maker should get a respective bug report or feature.\nWill unofficial hacks like Power Mode or DynRPG work with EasyRPG? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell; we don\u0026rsquo;t know if they do, and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to account for them. We often need help from developers familiar with those hacks or their creators so that we can better focus on getting RPG Maker completely reimplemented.\nCan I run games using EasyRPG on this platform or operating system? Probably. EasyRPG Player uses SDL on most platforms, which itself has been ported to a wide range of platforms.\nAbout the editor I\u0026rsquo;ve modified a game that was made in RPG Maker. Can I save it back to RPG Maker\u0026rsquo;s format? Yes. EasyRPG Editor allows to load/save in native (LCF) RPG Maker format.\nWill the editor have new features? It\u0026rsquo;s planned, but our main priority is compatibility. That means the editor will get a smaller focus until the player is accurate. The editor\u0026rsquo;s code depends a lot on the player and it needs to be stabilized first.\nAbout the goals When will the project be completed? When it finishes. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a timeframe.\nIf you want the project to be completed sooner, you can contribute! After all, the people most interested in EasyRPG are the ones working to complete it.\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/user/player/compat/","title":"Game Compatibility List","tags":[],"description":"","content":"We are currently in the process to integrate wiki content into the main website.

To study them you need to learn about RPG Maker 2000/2003 first. RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 reached end of life in Japan and there are no trial versions available to download. Hovever, there are official English translations currently. There are no evaluation versions of them, but copies are usually cheap when in offer, from https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/, Steam, Humble Bundle and maybe from other stores.\nOnce you have RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 downloaded you can see how it works: Map editor with database. You can refer to the RPG Maker 200x help files to know more about games are created.\nWhen you create a new project it will be in a new folder, containing these RPG Maker 200x project files:\n RPG_RT.exe (game executable) RPG_RT.ini (configuration file) RPG_RT.ldb (database) RPG_RT.lmt (map and area tree) MapXXXX.lmu (map and area files)  Folders inside project folder are for material data.\nUnderstanding RGSS/RGSS2/RGSS3 Next generation RPG Makers are RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace. These RPG Makers are officially translated into English. They feature scripting system, written in Ruby language. Most engine system is available in standard script sources. RGSS means Ruby Game Scripting System. EasyRPG does not plan to support them, there are other open source projects that implemented it.\nRPG Maker 200x internals works in certain form like RPG Maker XP/VX, so checking how these system work. You can press F11 in these rpg makers to open scripts editor. We got inspiration for some design decisions for EasyRPG.

This page tries to list them.\nUnofficial RPG Maker functionality can come in the following forms:\n modified engine executable, RPG_RT.exe, IPS file (they can be used to modify the executable by a tool like LunarIPS, or applied dynamically by DynRPG), HPA file to modify the executable by HyperPatcher2, manual replacement of values at given offsets (can be done in hex editor, or applied dynamically through QuickPatches in DynRPG) replacement for the audio library, Harmony.dll, DynRPG plugins to be applied by DynRPG, external utilities called by some other patch, external utility to apply the patch.  Harmony.dll replacements Changing harmony.dll allows to do external without modifying the main binary.\nHarmony.dll is used for audio playback in RPG Maker 2000 (except Value!) and RPG Maker 2003 up to version 1.04. A patch, Force Harmony, was made to allow using Harmony.dll in newer RPG Maker 2003.\nKey Patch by Ineluki Supports: RPG Maker 2000 up to 1.10 (everything before VALUE!), RPG Maker 2003 up to version 1.04\nTo work with any other version, game needs to be patched with Force Harmony.\nExecutes scripts via the \u0026lsquo;Play sound\u0026rsquo; command, and returns data through the midi ticks. Scripts are stored as sounds with .script.wav extension (the format of .script.wav is similar to INI files).\nAlso, allows to play MP3 (and theoretically also WMA) files by creating text files with .link.wav extension (a feature that was carried over from the older MP3 patch by Ineluki). Since this procedure is not managed by the game engine, music continues to play even if another track is started without correctly terminating the last one.\nIf FFDShow or something similar is installed, it may spam new symbols to task bar with every new file played until Harmony resets or game is closed.\nThe Key Patch is able to break system stability when starting a game if it gets prevented by a firewall to monitor key inputs.\nScripts allow to:\n Get full keyboard input Get mouse input (only works correctly in fullscreen) Execute arbitrary programs Execute MCI command Write information to log  Since it allows to execute arbitrary exe files, it opened a way for a lot of smaller utilities.\nDownload: http://www.rpg2000.4players.de:1061/sonstiges/utils/InelukiKeyPatchv1-2.zip\nGames using it: Detectivus Scitus\nRPG Maker 2000 and 2003 patches Auto Enter Patch by Miroku Skips the title screen of RPG Maker, allowing to create custom title screens. When used, the title screen will still show up, but is confirmed to start a new game instantly. To remove every disturbing detail, title and system graphic should be changed to empty black and the confirmation sound effect needs to be \u0026ldquo;(OFF)\u0026rdquo;. It is recommended to use Better AEP (see below) instead.\nSimilar patch is available for RPG Maker 2003.\nFIXME [description, examples]\nDownload: http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/AutoEnterPatch.exe\nBetterAEP by Cherry Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08 (distributed as a modified binary)\nSkips the title screen in a different more efficient way than Auto Enter Patch (see above) and allows to call load menu and exit game.\nStop Parallel Events is modified: When variable 3350 contains the value of 1, it calls a file menu in load mode. When it contains the value of 2, it exits the game. When it contains any other value (such as 0), Stop Parallel Events works normal.\nDownload: http://cherrytree.at/cms/download/?did=17\nPicPointerPatch Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08 (distributed as IPS patches)\nAllows to use the ID of picture stored in a variable.\nIf N+10000 is entered as a picture ID, the picture ID is read from variable N.\nIf N+50000 is entered as a picture ID, the picture ID is read from variable N, and the last 4 digits of variable (N+1) replace the last 4 characters of the picture name (for example, if TestTest.png is selected, and N+1 contains 5, then the filename will be Test0005.png).\nDownload: http://cherrytree.at/cms/download/?did=19\nCharExpand Patch by Cherry / Il Segugio Allows to use character graphics with arbitrary dimensions, as in newer RPG Maker versions. For this, Charsets must be named %XXYYName.png, where XX is width of one sprite divided by 4, and YY is height of one sprite divided by 4.\nAn adaptation of this script for RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.08 was made by Il Segugio.\nRM2k, description and download here: http://cherrytree.at/cms/lang/en/download/?did=18 RM2k3, description: http://www.makerando.com/topic/345-charexpand-patch-2k3/ RM2k3, download: http://www.mediafire.com/download/83ihq0oz21ov5l7/CEP%5Bplus+%5D+-+RPG_RT2k3+v1.08.ips\nPicsInBattle Supports: RM2k v1.07 and RM2k3 v1.08\nThis patch allows to show pictures in battle.

The newer code allows to play MP3, but Harmony.dll was used not just for playing music — it was a DLL for executing custom code, as done by Ineluki\u0026rsquo;s Key Patch (see above),\nTo allow using Ineluki\u0026rsquo;s Key Patch and other Harmony Replacements, this patch changes RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.05 and above to use Harmony.dll. After this, RM2k3 v. 1.05 and above can no longer play MP3, since Harmony.dll doesn’t support MP3 (unless another patch like Disharmony is used).\nDownload: http://cherrytree.at/cms/lang/en/download/?did=4\nDynRPG by Cherry Supports: RPG Maker 2003 v. 1.08\nAn ambitious project to create a C++ SDK for RPG Maker 2003.

Unfortunately, they are Windows-specific.\nDescription here: http://rpg-maker.cherrytree.at/dynrpg/\nKnown hacks Some hacks are not presented as patches, but instead are done by every game creator manually, either with a hex editor, or with a specialised program.\nChanged resources (EXFONT, logos, icons) The simplest type of hacks involves change of resources using Windows resource editors, such as Resource Hacker (proprietary freeware).\nThis way you can change an:\n EXFONT, a font containing additional characters available via the $ sign, Enterbrain/ASCII logos at the beginning of the game, application icon.  FIXME [Need examples]\nA custom EXFONT can be used by placing ExFont.bmp/.png in the games main directory. This will override the built-in ExFont.\nChanged fonts Using custom fonts may be required if your language is not supported.\nCherry’s Font Changer (download) and HyperPatcher2 allow to do this automatically, but it’s not hard to do in a hex editor either.\nNote. Changing fonts doesn’t always require hacking an exe file. Sometimes games don’t change the font name, and just replace the default font (e. g. Czech game Broken Hearts comes with its own RMG2000 font).\nFIXME [Need description and examples]\nChanged characters in \u0026lsquo;Enter hero name\u0026rsquo; form FIXME [Need description and examples]\nText speed change The 2k3 Hack: The end of your slow text speed woes! tutorial on http://rpgmaker.net describes how to change the font speed.\nFIXME [Need examples]\nAdditional data Cherry’s Hyper Patcher (download; supports RPG Maker 2000 v 1.05, RPG Maker 2003 v1.04 and RPG Maker 2003 v1.08) allows to change a number of other things, mostly cosmetic:\n Main:  Slightly different battle system interface, Hide start logos,   Title screen changes:  Automatically move cursor to \u0026lsquo;Load\u0026rsquo;, Show \u0026lsquo;Load\u0026rsquo; even when there is no data, Swap \u0026lsquo;Load\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;End\u0026rsquo; functions, Show only 2 first entries Position of X, Y on the title screen Never draw the \u0026lsquo;Load\u0026rsquo; menu in gray   In-game menu changes:  Hide last items in the RM2k menu (Item, Skill, Equip, Save, Exit; or Item, Skill, Equip, Save; or Item, Skill, Equip; or Item, Skill) Change colour of different menu items Hide party gold   Load/save menu:  Hide HP Hide level    External utilities Sometimes external programs are made to be called through the Ineluki\u0026rsquo;s key patch (or other means?).\nFIXME\nPowerPatch Compact by Cherry Description and download here: http://cherrytree.at/cms/download/?did=8\nSave/Load Script by Vampire of Eternal Chaos Provides programs ExitGame.exe, ExitSaveLoad.exe, Load.exe, Save.exe, SaveCounter.exe, SaveInfo.exe, SaveInfoSet.exe,\nAccording to the documentation, it depends on the following:\n Ineluki Key Patch Auto Enter Patch ScreenEffect script / SFX.exe AutoHotkey  Download: http://wombatrpgs.net/downloads.php?view=detail\u0026amp;df_id=40\u0026amp;sid=4f27d18fac38d32dd3a85b9745e04e22\nScreenshot script by Miroku Allows to make a screenshot and save it in the Pictures folder (converting to 256 colours).\nDownload: http://dl1.rpg-atelier.net/ressourcen2/programme/Effect.exe\nReferences  http://www.multimediaxis.de/threads/105858-Liste-der-Patches-Tools-f%C3%BCr-den-RM2k%283%29 http://rpgmaker.net/forums/topics/689/ http://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/50/ http://rpgmaker.su/f2/rpg-maker-2009-ultimate-895/index2 http://cherrytree.at/cms/download/?did=8 http://rpgmaker.net/forums/topics/689/ http://rmrk.net/index.php?topic=32090.0 http://cherrytree.at/cms/lang/en/download/?category=5  "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/data-structure-reference/","title":"LCF data structure reference","tags":[],"description":"","content":"  Audio Information   data-types   LcfDataBase   LcfMapTree   LcfMapUnit   LcfSaveData   "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/data-structure-reference/lcfdatabase/","title":"LcfDataBase","tags":[],"description":"","content":"File Name  \u0026ldquo;RPG_RT.ldb\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;ldb\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Lcf\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Data\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Base\u0026rdquo;  Header  \u0026ldquo;LcfDataBase\u0026rdquo;  Global Array  Data Type: 1 Dimensional Array     Index Detail Data Type Default Value etc.     11 ./LcfDataBase/Character 2 Dimensional Array     12 ./LcfDataBase/Skill 2 Dimensional Array     13 ./LcfDataBase/Item 2 Dimensional Array     14 ./LcfDataBase/Enemy 2 Dimensional Array     15 [./LcfDataBase/Enemy Group](/LcfDataBase/Enemy Group) 2 Dimensional Array     16 ./LcfDataBase/Terrain 2 Dimensional Array     17 ./LcfDataBase/Attribute 2 Dimensional Array     18 ./LcfDataBase/Condition 2 Dimensional Array     19 [./LcfDataBase/Battle Animation](/LcfDataBase/Battle Animation) 2 Dimensional Array     20 ./LcfDataBase/ChipSet 2 Dimensional Array     21 ./LcfDataBase/Vocabulary 1 Dimensional Array     22 ./LcfDataBase/System 1 Dimensional Array     23 ./LcfDataBase/Switch 2 Dimensional Array     24 ./LcfDataBase/Variable 2 Dimensional Array     From Here 2003\u0026rsquo;s or Later       25 [./LcfDataBase/Common Event](/LcfDataBase/Common Event) 2 Dimensional Array     26 [./LcfDataBase/Common Event](/LcfDataBase/Common Event) 2 Dimensional Array     27 [./LcfDataBase/Common Event](/LcfDataBase/Common Event) 2 Dimensional Array     28 [./LcfDataBase/Common Event](/LcfDataBase/Common Event) 2 Dimensional Array     25 [./LcfDataBase/Battle Command](/LcfDataBase/Battle Command) 1 Dimensional Array     25 ./LcfDataBase/Job 2 Dimensional Array     25 [./LcfDataBase/Battle Command 2](/LcfDataBase/Battle Command 2) 2 Dimensional Array      "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/data-structure-reference/lcfmaptree/","title":"LcfMapTree","tags":[],"description":"","content":"File Name  \u0026ldquo;RPG_RT.lmt\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;lmt\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;Lcf\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Map\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Tree\u0026rdquo;  Header  \u0026ldquo;LcfMapTree\u0026rdquo;  Global Array  Data Type: 2 Dimensional Array [0]: Root.

There are different types but RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 only support BMP files with the following specifications:\n Uncompressed BMP (RLE compression is not supported) 8 bit indexed palette, 256 colors (not 24 bit, not 2, 4 bit or other indexed palette formats)  PNG PNG is the Portable Network Graphics format. RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 supports it with following restriction:\n 8 bit indexed palette, 256 colors (not truecolor 24/32 bit, not 2, 4 bit or other indexed palette formats).  Information chunks about alpha transparency, transparent color key, multiplane (APNG), gamma, color profiles, etc. will be ignored.\nThis is the recommended format to work with the RTP replacement material.\nXYZ XYZ is a graphics format made for RPG Maker 2000 and 2003. RPG Maker can import and export graphics supported by RPG Maker in this format. The features are 8 bit palette and a maximum of 65536x65536 pixels.\nGraphic size requirements Backdrop 320x 160 pixels (RPG Maker 2000 and 2003) 320x 240 (RPG Maker 2003)\nIf you want to contribute graphics to the RTP replacement, best use a proportion 4:3 like 320x240 to do it. A good practice is not to put any important decoration under the 80 last horizontal pixel rows, the battle menu goes there. You can do larger graphics, as 640x480 and larger, if the EasyRPG project wants to go higher resolution in the future, specially if you are not making the battle background using pixel art: it\u0026rsquo;s easy to scale down the graphic up to 320x240.\nBattle Oficially, 480x480 pixels. You can do 480xMultipleOf96 up to 480, for example: 480x96, 480x192, 480x288, 480x384, 480x480.\nIf the image height is not a multiple the sprites (a grid of 5 96x96 sprite frames for row) could be shown cut.\nBattle2 Only supported on 2003, a bit larger battle animations than Battle, 640x640 (128x128 sprite frames for row). There is no material to do for the RTP replacement.\nBattleCharSet Only supported on 2003, 144x384 pixels. 3 planes each row, 8 rows, each sprite frame is 48x48 pixels.\nFIXME [Graphic template will be here]\nBattleWeapon Only supported on 2003, 192x512 pixels. 3 planes each row, 8 rows, each sprite frame is 64x64 pixels.\nThe weapon sprite position is centered with the sprite position on the battle.\nFIXME [Graphic template will be here]\nCharSet 288x256 pixels.

FIXME\nMusic file formats Used in the folder:\n Music  MID MIDI Standard Format. There are two versions, the most common is format 1.\nTo edit .MID files, you can use Winjammer Shareware 3.0 (32 bit). This is an old piece of software. The web of Winjammer Software disapeared. The trial version only puts \u0026ldquo;Winjammer Demo\u0026rdquo; in the name of the tracks. You can get it at FIXME thesonicspot.com\nTo make a game loop just put an event controller 111 in the desired position of return when the song ends. If you don\u0026rsquo;t put the 111 event, RPG Maker will loop to the initial position. If you want to disable looping just put the 111 event at the end of the song, to make a silent loop to itself without more events.\nUse standard General MIDI set. For the percussion use the channel 10 you can use the less standard kits, as Roland Sound Canvas kits, widely supported (several RTP songs make use of them). Use standard drum kit only (patch 1, bank none, channel 10) if you want to maximize compatibility with higher amount of MIDI players. Don\u0026rsquo;t use System Exclusive.\nWAV WAV is a common used Windows audio RIFF container. RPG Maker only supports PCM and ADPCM codecs. You can use 8/16 bit PCM and some FIXME ADPCM resolutions. MPEG and other codecs are not suported inside the WAV container in RPG Maker. You can use different frequencies, as 8-11-22-44-48 kHz. Mono and Stereo.\nMP3 RPG Maker supports native MP3 format since RPG Maker 2000 version 1.50 or later and RPG Maker 2003 version 1.05 or later. We recommend at least 1.51 and 1.06 respectively for a serious bug fix when playing MP3 files.\nMP3 stands for a MPEG container with the MPEG 1 layer III codec. Is a compressed lossy format. The MP3 audio format is still covered with patents in several countries.\nTo encode MP3 files we recommend LAME encoder.\nSound file formats The folder:\n Sound  Support WAV file format.

If your target is any Linux flavour it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to just install all dependencies with your package manager\u0026hellip;\nEasyRPG Player is quite portable application but you will probably encounter some problems in your porting adventure. This article will sum up the common pitfalls you will encounter:\nLibrary porting EasyRPG needs at least the following libraries.\n liblcf (see next section) freetype pixman libpng zlib SDL2 and SDL2_mixer (if supported by your platform, read \u0026ldquo;Porting without SDL support\u0026rdquo; otherwise)  More dependencies are required when you use the SDL2 backend. This will be explained later.\nCross compiling is usually straight forward for any library via the typical commands:\n./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --host=$TARGET_HOST --disable-shared --enable-static \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make install\nzlib is an exception:\nCHOST=$TARGET_HOST ./configure --static --prefix=$PREFIX\nYou should in general know how to do this and fill $PREFIX and $TARGET_HOST with the correct values. Otherwise this article is not suitable for you ;)\npixman supports fast code paths for many platforms. If your platform supports any SIMD you should turn on the appropriate flags during compile time (check the help output).\nPorting liblcf liblcf is the parser for RPG Maker 2000/2003 files. Make sure the liblcf version matches the same git tag the Player uses (or use the git version if you compile Player from git).\nliblcf uses the the following libraries:\n iconv or ICU expat (optional)  iconv or ICU are required for converting the text strings to Unicode. ICU is recommended over iconv because it supports automatic codepage detection and will make the life of the user much simpler.\nPorting ICU Cross compiling ICU is a bit tricky, get version 56.1 (important!) and do the following steps:\nTo save 20 MB of library size replace the icudata with ours: icudata\nCopy icudt56l.dat into icu/source/data/in/\nDuplicate now the folder icu and name it icu-native. The further steps assume now that you have these two folders.\nICU needs a native compilation first because it needs an executable to generate the data lib:\ncd icu-native/source\n./configure --enable-static --enable-shared=no --enable-tests=no --enable-samples=no --enable-dyload=no --enable-tools --enable-extras=no --enable-icuio=no --with-data-packaging=static\nmake\nexport ICU_CROSS_BUILD=$PWD\nNow cross compile ICU:\ncd icu/source\n./configure --with-cross-build=$ICU_CROSS_BUILD --enable-strict=no --enable-static --enable-shared=no --enable-tests=no --enable-samples=no --enable-dyload=no --enable-tools=no --enable-extras=no --enable-icuio=no --host=$TARGET_HOST --with-data-packaging=static --prefix=$PREFIX\n\u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;make \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make install '\u0026rsquo;\nPorting SDL If the target platform is supported by SDL2 you are lucky. You just compile SDL2 and SDL2_mixer now and you are almost done because you can use the SDL backend of the Player.\nThe SDL2_mixer should be compiled with support for WAV, OGG, MP3 and MIDI. MOD support is useful but not used by many games:\n OGG: libvorbis or tremor (faster, for embedded hardware) MP3: libmad or smpeg2. libmad is more stable then smpeg2 (crashes less ;)) MIDI: Timidity or fluidsynth MOD: modplug or libmikmod. Modplug supports more formats.  If you use a custom makefile to compile the Player make sure to define USE_SDL\nPorting without SDL support Now the fun begins. You have to write a new Ui which extends from the BaseUi class.\nThe important functions are blablabla\nblabla AudioInterface\nblabla Input\nAdditional problems you have to solve blabla FileFinder and read/write\nblabla GameBrowser\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/development/data-structure-reference/lcfsavedata/preview/","title":"Preview","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Data Type: 1 Dimensional Array     Index Detail Data Type Default Value etc.     1 Delphi\u0026rsquo;s TDateTime Double  http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/delphivclwin32/System_TDateTime.html   11 Front Character\u0026rsquo;s Name String     12 Front Character\u0026rsquo;s Level Integer     13 Front Character\u0026rsquo;s HP Integer     21 1st Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet String     22 1st Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet Index Integer 0    23 2nd Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet String     24 2nd Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet Index Integer 0    25 3rd Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet String     26 3rd Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet Index Integer 0    27 4th Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet String     28 4th Character\u0026rsquo;s FaceSet Index Integer 0     "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/technical-details/rpg-maker-2003-version-history/","title":"RPG Maker 2003 version history","tags":[],"description":"","content":"RPG Maker 2003 version history Backup from https://web.archive.org/web/20080325201422/http://www.phylomortis.com:80/html/rm2k3vh.html\nThis changelog does not include official English release patched version, only original Japanese updates.\nVersion 1.09 (January 14, 2004) Bug Fixes:  When magic is reflected by a character with the \u0026ldquo;reflect\u0026rdquo; condition, the problem where the proper battle animation would sometimes not play on the new target was corrected. The problem where damage indication would occur on the fifth frame of the animation when using an item that mimics a skill was corrected. The problem where \u0026ldquo;Enable Combo\u0026rdquo; would not stick after certain battle events were executed was fixed. The problem where repeatedly changing class would cause the character\u0026rsquo;s stats to drop regardless of class settings was fixed. The problem where weapon animation was slow or nonexistant in the weapon animation settings screen was corrected. The problem where the stat bonuses from some equipment would persist after changing class when that equipment was unequipped was fixed.  Version 1.08 (September 22, 2003) Bug Fixes:  Fixed the problem where games would randomly crash when a skill was used. The problem where skills that increased attack power would only do so for one turn was corrected. The problem where the character battle animations screwed up for characters that had been confused the previous battle was fixed. When a character is revived in combat, the game should no longer crash if an enemy is killed immediately following. In battles using the Traditional layout, a defeated enemy\u0026rsquo;s name will now disappear from the monster list immediately instead of at the next targeting prompt.  Version 1.07 (July 15, 2003) Bug Fixes:  When using the \u0026ldquo;two weapons\u0026rdquo; option, the problem where the damage equation did not scale correctly to large numbers was fixed. The problem where the game would crash if a confused ally attacks with the long-range weapon animation setting \u0026ldquo;attack each enemy in turn\u0026rdquo; was used is now fixed. If a character had a status ailment that altered attack power coexisting with another status ailment, the damage dealt would not reflect the attack power change. This has been fixed.  Version 1.06 (June 24, 2003) Changed Feature:  When a skill is used, any damage value and any enemy deaths associated with it are shown at the end of the animation, regardless of the animation\u0026rsquo;s length.  Bug Fixes:  When a character attacks more than once due to \u0026ldquo;Enable Combo\u0026rdquo; and kills a monster, that character will move on to any remaining targets if additional attacks remain. The problem where save data from games made with version 1.04 or earlier could not be read was corrected. All MP3 files should be recognized, regardless of ID3 tags or encoding method. Optimized the program to work with certain MIDI synthesizers. The problem where sometimes the damage value shown was not equal to the damage actually recorded by the engine was fixed. If a character with the \u0026ldquo;two weapons\u0026rdquo; option uses weapons with different attack power levels and/or attributes, the weapons should now behave independently of each other for purposes of calculating damage. With regard to \u0026ldquo;key input processing\u0026rdquo;, the repeat rate for the shift key was changed. When using \u0026ldquo;extended\u0026rdquo; battle animations for your character battle animations, the preview should now show properly in the editor.  Version 1.05 (May 13, 2003) New Features:  You can now nest \u0026ldquo;\\n\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\\v\u0026rdquo;, so you could do \u0026ldquo;\\n[\\v[1]]\u0026rdquo; to show the name of the character with ID stored in variable 1. The picture limit is increased from 40 to 50. When using \u0026ldquo;key input processing\u0026rdquo;, it is now possible to disallow input of certain direction keys while allowing others. \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; was added as a possible key for \u0026ldquo;key input processing\u0026rdquo;. You can make message text move more quickly by pressing the decision key during play (mirrors the feature that has always existed in test play). MP3 files can now be used for BGM. You can now target heroes when using the \u0026ldquo;show battle animation\u0026rdquo; battle event command. MP is now indicated in the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; battle system type. \u0026ldquo;Input Number\u0026rdquo; has been added to the battle event options. No need to use a common event to invoke it now. You can now speed up the display of character battle animations in the editor so that you can see how they will look in battle more easily. You can now type in a message to display if an ability misses. For instance, if you use an ability that causes poisoning, but the monster has poison resistance, causing the attack to miss, the term you enter will show.  Changed Features:  The image priority of pictures and battle animations was reversed. The variance in the number of steps between encounters for a given encounter rate has been reduced.  Bug Fixes:  The problem where \u0026ldquo;half MP consumption\u0026rdquo; items were not showing the correct modified MP cost in the menu was corrected. The problem where a battle event would occur twice when the battle event start condition \u0026ldquo;number of turns taken by character\u0026rdquo; was used was corrected. The problem where a character\u0026rsquo;s ATB gauge would freeze if the battle event start condition \u0026ldquo;[character] uses the [x] command\u0026rdquo; removed the character using it, then re-added the character to the party later, was fixed. Sometimes when the target of a status-removal spell was set to \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo;, and a monster used it, the status would not be cured and instead change to something random. This has been fixed. The problem where a battle event with the \u0026ldquo;[character] uses the [x] command\u0026rdquo; start condition combined with another start condition would execute even when only the battle command was chosen was fixed.  Version 1.04 (March 1, 2003) New Features:  When a monster afflicted with a status ailment is targeted, the name of the highest priority status ailment that monster is afflicted with will appear in a one-line message window at the top of the screen. During test play, you can now change the value of a variable to a seven-digit number when using the debug screen.  Deleted Feature:  When the feature-set was changed to show battle system messages on one line, the \u0026ldquo;show parameter increase on level-up\u0026rdquo; checkbox stopped working. This checkbox has now been deleted.  Changed Feature:  The way attribute damage modifiers for weapons are calculated has been changed as described below:  When a character attacks, the one weapon attribute and the one magic attribute with the highest damage multipliers are chosen from all weapon and magic attributes linked to that attack. The actual damage multiplier is an average of the two attributes chosen as described above. For instance, if the damage multiplier for the weapon attribute is 200% and the damage multiplier for the magic attribute is 50%, then the actual damage multiplier used is 200% x 50% = 100%. If one or both of the attributes has a negative damage multiplier (absorption), then the damage multiplier used is the largest of the negative values. For instance, if the damage multiplier for the weapon attribute is 200%, and the damage multiplier for the magic attribute is -50%, then the actual damage multiplier used is -50%.    Bug Fixes:  When using a battle event with the trigger \u0026ldquo;Monster HP above X% and below Y%\u0026rdquo;, the problem where the triggered event was beginning during the damage animation was fixed. The problem where there was a delay in the execution of skills or items of the type \u0026ldquo;Switch ON\u0026rdquo; has been fixed. The problem where the wrong hero would receive poison damage if another hero selected his action before the poisoned hero finished his action was fixed. The problem where sometimes battle events with the trigger \u0026ldquo;Monster HP above X% and below Y%\u0026rdquo; that only concerned the first enemy in a group would not execute was corrected. When a \u0026ldquo;show picture\u0026rdquo; event with the option \u0026ldquo;picture scrolls with map\u0026rdquo; was used, sometimes a \u0026ldquo;move picture\u0026rdquo; event would move the picture to the wrong coordinates, as if the \u0026ldquo;picture scrolls with map\u0026rdquo; box hadn\u0026rsquo;t been checked. This problem has been fixed. The problem where an incorrect number of floppies was required to make a game disk was corrected. This was causing game disks extracted by other means than executing \u0026ldquo;setup.exe\u0026rdquo; to become corrupt. Fixed the problem where a hero afflicted with a status ailment that caused him to attack his allies and equipped with a weapon that inflicts a status ailment had no chance of inflicting that weapon\u0026rsquo;s status ailment on the attacked ally. Fixed the problem where sometimes the hero would not face the proper direction after a \u0026ldquo;teleport\u0026rdquo; event command. The problem where the use of \u0026ldquo;Link to Event\u0026rdquo; type battle commands would freeze the battle is fixed. Fixed the problem where no more than 999 damage was dealt when using the \u0026ldquo;% of current HP\u0026rdquo; option in the \u0026ldquo;Change Monster HP\u0026rdquo; event command.  Version 1.03 (February 5, 2003) New Features:  In \u0026ldquo;Alternative\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gauge\u0026rdquo; type battles, the character selected for command entry blinks. The bouncing numbers for damage in battle are shown more slowly. In the event command \u0026ldquo;Enemy Encounter\u0026rdquo;, the ability to select \u0026ldquo;Background associated with the selected terrain\u0026rdquo; was added.  Bug Fixes:  The problem where some of the icons on the editor toolbar were not being shown was corrected. The problem where the battle events with the trigger \u0026ldquo;Monster HP % between X and Y\u0026rdquo; were not being executed was fixed. Fixed the bug where the game would sometimes crash if an enemy was defeated with a skill. Fixed the bug where if you showed a battle animation on the field with \u0026ldquo;global scope\u0026rdquo; and then immediately entered a battle, the game would crash. Corrected timing for playback of large-sized poses in battle.  Version 1.02 (January 15, 2003) New Features:  \u0026ldquo;Reverse battle animations when attacking from opposite direction\u0026rdquo; checkbox was added to the \u0026ldquo;System 2\u0026rdquo; section of the database. This will flip all non-pose battle animations horizontally when the characters are on the opposite side of the monsters due to back attack or surround attack. During battle, if a skill or item is used, the name of the skill or item is shown briefly in a one-line message window before it executes.  Bug Fixes:  Corrected the problem in which the level up message was not being shown if the checkbox \u0026ldquo;show level-up message\u0026rdquo; in the battle event \u0026ldquo;Change character level\u0026rdquo; was checked. The \u0026ldquo;change monster MP\u0026rdquo; battle event now allows the MP to be increased or decreased by up to 9999 rather than 999. Corrected the problem with the experience curve settings that sometimes made it so that more experience was required to go from level 1 to level 2 than to go from level 2 to level 3. The problem where sometimes battle events with the trigger \u0026ldquo;Hero\u0026rsquo;s HP between 0% and 0%\u0026rdquo; would not execute properly when the chosen hero\u0026rsquo;s HP becomes 0. The problem where a character with the \u0026ldquo;two weapons\u0026rdquo; option would attack twice if unarmed was fixed. When a game was converted from RPG Maker 2000 to RPG Maker 2003 format, the \u0026ldquo;move picture\u0026rdquo; command would lose its transparency setting. This has been fixed. The problem where the names of the default battle poses would not appear when a RPG Maker 2000 game was converted to RPG Maker 2003 format was corrected. The problem where a \u0026ldquo;boomerang-type\u0026rdquo; animation pattern for a weapon would loop infinitely was corrected. The problems where events linked to special battle commands would sometimes execute without the appropriate command being chosen was fixed. The problems with party members added during battle not being able to act were fixed.  Version 1.01a (December 28, 2002) Bug Fixes:  The problem where the game would sometimes crash if two skills that targetted an ally were used on successive turns was fixed. Corrected the problem in which the game would crash if a character or monster with an agility of 1 was afflicted with a status ailment that reduced its agility by half. Corrected the problem in which the game would sometimes crash if characters afflicted with a status ailment with the action restriction \u0026ldquo;randomly attack enemies\u0026rdquo; missed. The monster behavior precondition \u0026ldquo;party average level\u0026rdquo; can now be set from levels 1 to 99. The problem where a character would sometimes use a skill multiple times if it attacked multiple times on its previous turn was corrected.  Version 1.01 (December 19, 2002) Bug Fixes:  The problem where the game would crash if a character not equipped with a weapon attacked was corrected. The problem where battle animations associated with enemy attacks were not being shown was corrected.

If on the contrary we want a window, will be sent Window.\nSample usage By default the game is released in normal mode, showing the image of full-screen title. To change the behavior of the executable, shows the following examples:\nRPG_RT.exe TestPlay HideTitle Window  This will begin RPG_RT.exe in test mode of play, without displaying the image of the title and windowed mode.\nRPG_RT.exe BattleTest ShowTitle FullScreen 1  This will execute the game in test mode of battle testing with monster ID 0001, showing the image of full screen title.\nRPG_RT.exe Dummy Dummy Window  This execute the game in normal mode, showing the image of the title and window.\nNotes The parameters ShowTitle and FullScreen in fact do not exist for RPG_RT.exe are just dummy, what happens is that RPG2000.exe that defines itself by launching the test of the game or the test of battle.\nThe fourth parameter n is sent only to launch RPG_RT.exe with BattleTest.\nParameter names are case sensitive.\nRunning RPG_RT.exe with BattleTest, RPG_RT.ldb amending temporarily to launch the game and is restored when the performance ends.

Only Windows 2000 series were Unicode when RPG Maker 2000 was released, so Japanese programs in SHIFT_JIS or other Windows language versions are not working \u0026ldquo;out of the box\u0026rdquo; between old, non-Unicode, Windows versions. Windows XP is the first Windows NT for the mainstream featuring Unicode support but it was too late. Windows 9x were still supported during a couple of years.\nThe problem Fortunately, Don Miguel, the nickname of the unofficial translator of the most famous RPG Maker 2000 version made a translation of the RTP files of RPG Maker 2000 into English and became a de facto standard for non-Japanese users worldwide. However you need the Japanese RTP to play Japanese RTP-dependent games and the Don\u0026rsquo;s English RTP to play Don\u0026rsquo;s RTP-dependent games.\nThe increased popularity after the English translation became a mess when 2003 was released. Multiple unofficial translations emerged at once and the difficulties to play RTP dependent games increased.\nThe main challenge for EasyRPG is to take support of different games (Japanese, English\u0026hellip;) using any RTP translation available with the same RTP replacement. This includes possible RTP translation caveats (added, removed files\u0026hellip;).\nThe solution Use a common and unique files and a reference table passed to the game interpreter to return the correct file referred by the game.\nIf RPG_RT.ini does not have the FullPackageFlag=1 directive (it means don\u0026rsquo;t use RTP), the EasyRPG interpreter will make use of the RTP replacement. Proposed places: Windows: Similar (not equal) as original RTP registry path. UNIX based: /usr/share/easyrpg/rtp/ path. Inside of these paths a new file as a little standalone database will indicate to the interpreter which file name string is assigned.

A good way to understand the way it\u0026rsquo;s used is through Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s tools; developers that use Visual Studio often include Visual C++ Redistributables and the .NET Framework, or they have to tell the user to download it from Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s website.\nThe installer for the RTP is given out by RPG Maker\u0026rsquo;s vendor at their homepage for anyone to download but not to share.\nThe better games often don\u0026rsquo;t use this package to ease the burden of having to install more prerequisites just to get the game working, and because they use original assets that the RTP would have no use replacing.

If the Colourmap window says ‘Only indexed images have a colormap’, make the image indexed with Mode → Image → Indexed. Note that if your image has more than 255 colours, some might be lost during the conversion. If you need more colours, you probably shouldn’t use the RPG Maker 2000/2003 image format: EasyRPG supports other formats, so try these.\n2. Identify the transparent colour on the image. In the colormap, there are several pink colours that look like the transparent colour. We need to find out which one is really transparent. The easiest way for this is to use Eyedropper tool.\n3. Try changing the colour that you think is transparent: double-click it and change the colour.\nIf you’ve changed the colour and the background didn’t change, it means you’ve edited the wrong colour. Undo your colour change (Ctrl+Z) and try again.\nIf the background colour of the image changes, it means you’ve identified the real transparent colour. In our example, colour 225 is the correct transparent colour:\nAfter you’ve identified the transparent colour, you can revert it to being pink, or change it to a different colour. EasyRPG Player doesn’t care about the exact colour, it’s only for people looking at the image in the editor and in the file manager.\n(By the way, you can see that a pixel in the bottom part of some doors is still pink. This is a mistake: the pixel was painted in a slightly different colour of pink, but EasyRPG would consider it a different colour. If you see such stray pixels on your image, this should be fixed.)\n4. After identifying the transparent colour, right-click on the colourmap and choose Rearrange Colourmap.\nN.B. Make sure there is no selection on your image when you are re-arranging a colourmap. If there is a selection, the colours outside that selection will be swapped.\n5. In the Rearrane Colormap window that will be opened, drag the transparent colour you’ve identified (it’s colour 225 in our example) and drop it at the beginning of the colourmap, before the Colour 0. It will become the new Colour 0 after the re-arrangement. Click OK.\n6. After the re-arrangement is complete, save the image as PNG.\nSetting transparency in RPG Maker 2000/2003 If you have an RPG Maker 2000 or 2003 installed, and the size of your image is standard, you can change the transparent colour of your image by importing it into a RPG Maker 2000/2003 project:\n1. Open any project. You can create a temporary project for this.\n2. Open Tools → Resource Manager in the official translation (or Raw Material Editor in Don Miguel\u0026rsquo;s translation).\n3. Choose the type of the resource you need (e.g. ChipSets).\n4. Choose \u0026lsquo;Import Format: PNG (Standard)\u0026rsquo;.\n5. Click Import.\n6. A window \u0026ldquo;Select Colour to be Transparent\u0026rdquo; will be opened. Click on the transparent colour in the image. All the transparent areas will start flashing.\n7. Click OK. The converted image with the correct transparent colour will be stored in the your project folder.\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/user/player/special-features/","title":"Special Features","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This site lists all features that are different to the original RPG_RT.\nSupport for games of any language The original RPG_RT has problems handling games from countries that use characters which are not in the current codepage of the system.\nExample: If you life in England your (Windows) system has the codepage for Western European (1252) set. With this codepage it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to play Russian or Japanese games because their characters are not encoded in this codepage. This problem applies to all older applications that are not Unicode aware. Unicode is an encoding that provides a mapping for all characters used in the world.\nThe EasyRPG Player is of course unicode aware but you have to hint him, what encoding the game uses. The encoding is automatically guessed from database terms tab texts. However, encoding can be overridden by editing the RPG_RT.ini in the game folder and adding the following entry:\n[EasyRPG] Encoding=#### \n#### must be replaced by a number that specifes the codepage, for example:\n   Name Number Use for     Western European 1252 English games or games from most western Europe and America countries   Windows-1251 1251 Cyrillic games (full Cyrillic support for Russian and other languages)   Windows-1250 1250 Central European games (mostly Latin Extended A glyphs)   Shift-JIS 932 Japanese games (with Hiragana, Katakana or Kanji)   Big5 950 Traditional Chinese games (Taiwan, Hong Kong)    Both automatic detection and RPG_RT.ini Encoding value can be overriden by using the --encoding command line interface option.\nSupport for all known RTP editions It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you have official Japanese, English RTP or unofficial translations installed. The player will take care of loading the correct files for you, just make sure that the games encoding is set to the correct value.\n"},{"uri":"/wiki/development/encoding-list/","title":"Supported Encodings","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This lists the currently supported encodings of liblcf.\n   Human readable name Mapping table (ICU) Codepage (iconv)     Japanese ibm-943_P15A-2003 932   Korean windows-949-2000 949   ::: (needs ibm-1363_P11B-1998)    Central Europe ibm-5346_P100-1998 1250   Cyrillic 1 ibm-5347_P100-1998 1251   Occidental 1 ibm-5348_P100-1997 1252   Greek 1 ibm-5349_P100-1998 1253   Hebrew 1 ibm-9447_P100-2002 1255   Arabic 1 2 ibm-9448_X100-2005 1256   Thai 1 windows-874-2000 874   Chinese simplified windows-936-2000 936   ::: (needs ibm-1386_P100-2001)    Chinese traditional windows-950-2000 950   ::: (needs ibm-1373_P100-2002)    Turkish ibm-5350_P100-1998 1254   Baltic ibm-9449_P100-2002 1257      with Euro\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n + 8 chars\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/data-structure-reference/lcfdatabase/switch/","title":"Switch","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Data Type: 2 Dimensional Array     Index Detail Data Type Default Value etc.     1 Name String \u0026quot;\u0026quot;     "},{"uri":"/wiki/development/technical-details/system-graphics/","title":"System graphics technical details","tags":[],"description":"","content":"System graphics technical details This is implemented now in Player.\ntake_cheeze\u0026rsquo;s translation Basic  Directory: \u0026ldquo;System/\u0026rdquo; Size: 160(width) x 80(height)  Detail  (x, y): coordinate (AxB): Size (Optionally \u0026ldquo;Pattern\u0026rdquo;) A: Window\u0026rsquo;s wallpaper  (0,0) (32x32) Transparent Color: disabled If wallpaper type is TILE it will be tiled from left-top   B: Window Parts  (32, 0) (32x32) 0 - x: Frame y: Page Cursor Up z: Page Cursor Down / Waiting at text Transparent Color: enabled   C: Command Cursor  (64, 0) (32x32 x 2 Pattern) 0 - x: Frame y: Inside  If wallpaper type is TILE it will be tiled from left-top   Transparent Color: enabled   D: Shop\u0026rsquo;s equip difference symbol  (128, 0) (8x8 x 4 Pattern) 0: up 1: no difference 2: down 3: equipped Transparent Color: enabled   E: Menu screen\u0026rsquo;s background  (0, 32) (16x16) Transparent Color: disabled Only the left-top 1x1 pixel of this segment will be used   F: Font\u0026rsquo;s shadow  (16, 32) (16x16) Transparent Color, enabled Only the left-top 1x1 pixel of this segment will be used   G: Timer character  (32, 32) (8x16 x 12 character) (32, 32) 0 - 9 (112, 32) separator (120, 32) space Transparent Color: enabled   H: Airship\u0026rsquo;s shadow  (128, 32) (16x16 x 2 Pattern) Transparent Color: enabled \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; FIXME really semitransparent   I: Font  (0, 48) (16x16 x 10) 0 〜 9 (0, 64) (16x16 x 10) 10 〜 19 0 〜 19 Transparent Color: disabled \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; FIXME disagree, please verify    Font Color Example  * 0: Default * 0: Enable * 3: Disable * 1: Status * 2: Parameter Up * 3: Parameter Down * 1: Money * 4: HP Low * 4: MP Low  Priority  There is a priority of how it\u0026rsquo;s rendered.

You need the latest version of the program in order to utilize them.\n Maximum level for heros is 99. Maximum HP is 9999. Maximum experience is 9999999. (Variables can now be up to seven digits, making the range -9999999 to 9999999.) (MP3 files can now be used for music.)This is not true. This is a new feature added in RPG Maker 2000 1.50 and made compatible since RPG Maker 2003 1.05. RPG Maker 2003 1.04 was not supporting MP3. You can define classes. Classes are defined the same way as heros, except that you can set a class\u0026rsquo;s default battle commands (explained next). If a hero has a class, it supercedes his natural stats and skill progression. You can edit a class\u0026rsquo;s default battle commands. When you open the battle command editor, you give your battle command a name and a characteristic. The characteristics are as follows:  Attack = Attack command Skill = Accesses the character\u0026rsquo;s full skill list Skill Subset = Accesses only the skills in this subset. Defend = Defend Item = Use an Item Escape = Run Away Link to Event = Does nothing by itself. This allows you to link the command to a battle event.   You can assign skills to subsets. To set up a subset, first make a battle command with the same name as the subset you want and select the \u0026ldquo;Skill Subset\u0026rdquo; characteristic. So, you could set up a subset called \u0026ldquo;Summon\u0026rdquo; and make summon spells that show up when you choose the summon command. You can now make spells that take a percentage of the character\u0026rsquo;s max MP. You can decide who can use equipment by hero or by class. You can make equipment that inflicts bad (or good) status when it\u0026rsquo;s equipped. You can make equipment that is usable as an item. For example, you could make a sword, that when used as an item, heals the character. You can make cursed items that can\u0026rsquo;t be unequipped by normal means. Monster max HP is 99999. You can set attributes that have a negative damage percentage (absorption). You could make a monster that heals when attacked with fire. You can make positive status, such as doubling a stat, regenerating HP or MP each turn or step on the map, making all physical attacks miss, or reflecting skill attacks. There are three battle types. They are:  Traditional: You must act in the order that characters\u0026rsquo; ATB bars become full. Alternative: Your characters can act in any order, so long as their ATB bars are full. Gauge: Same as Alternative, except that instead of a window with hero status at the bottom of the screen, the hero facesets are shown with gauges representing their HP, MP, and ATB guages.   You can now choose which sound effect plays when you walk over damaging terrain. You can now choose the frequency of Initiative, Back Attack, Surround Attack, and Pincers Attack. You can now choose which items are displayed on the main menu and in what order. You can now choose a frame, which is an image that is always displayed on the game screen. Good for action/RPGs. You can choose the way the numbers and gauges look in battle Battle backgrounds can now have two layers. Each layer can be set to scroll horizontally or vertically independent of the other, so you could have non-scrolling grass with slowly scrolling clouds in the background. You can now set a death handler for random encounters. For instance, you could make it so that if the party is defeated, they are returned to the last town and lose half their gold. You can now display 40 (50) pictures at once.Same behavior since RPG Maker 2000 1.50 and RPG Maker 2003 1.05. Better key processing (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Esc, (Shift), 0-9, +, -, *, /, .) When using key input processing and \u0026ldquo;wait until key pressed\u0026rdquo;, you can now save to a variable the amount of time it took the user to press a key. A couple of new weather effects, fog and heatwave. New screen shake effects Two timers can be running at once Battle animations can now have 500 frames. Additional Conditional Braching functions New battle event commands \u0026ldquo;Force Flee\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Enable Combo\u0026rdquo;: Force Flee allows you to make it certain that the party will flee if they choose to do so. You can also force a monster to flee using this command, regardless of its priority in its action profile. Enable Combo allows you to set the number of attacks that an \u0026ldquo;attack\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;skill\u0026rdquo; type battle command will perform, from 1 to 8. Think \u0026ldquo;offering\u0026rdquo; from FF6. Some commands that were only available out of battle in RM2K can now be called in-battle, including Show Choice and Change Money. There is a random dungeon generator, though it isn\u0026rsquo;t very good.. You can call common events in battle  "}]
