The first colour in the palette is considered transparent. So, if your graphics has a different colour arrangement, it might look transparent but wonâ€™t.
This is the recommended format to work with the RTP replacement material because people will be able to use your graphics in RPG Maker 2000/2003. Currently, the EasyRPG editor is not finished, so people still have rely to RPG Maker 2000/2003 for creating games to be played in EasyRPG.</description></item></channel></rss>
